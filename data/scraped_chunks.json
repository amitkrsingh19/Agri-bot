    "page_content": "1 \n \n \nExecutive Summary  \n \nThe United States Department of Agriculture’s (USDA’s) National Agricultural Statistics \nService (NASS) offers survey webpages designed to inform the public, including media, \nrespondents, trade partners, and other interested parties about their surveys. Visitors to these \nwebpages can find comprehensive information about the surveys, instructions and a link to web \nresponse, and other relevant materials. In 2020, NASS received valuable feedback from key data \nusers concerning estimates related to grains and oilseeds storage. In response to this input, a \ntechnical review was initiated to evaluate both the quarterly-conducted Crops Acreage, \nProduction, and Stocks (Crops APS) Survey and the Grain Stocks Report (GSR), which serve as \nthe basis for producing quarterly Grain Stocks publications. Following the research, a \nrecommendation was made to establish a team to tackle the challenge of improving response \nrates through enhanced outreach and engagement efforts (Ridolfo et al. 2021). The GSR \nOutreach Team was formed with the objective of refining strategies for outreach, engagement, \nand the effective communication of survey information exclusively to GSR respondents.  \nUpon evaluating the GSR, the Outreach Team identified a lower level of response for web \nsubmissions compared to phone or email methods. Despite providing a link and relevant \ninformation for web responses on the GSR webpage, analytics indicated decreased engagement \non the GSR webpage in comparison to other survey webpages. The GSR webpage provides \ninformation on the Grain Stocks publication, which includes information collected from the two \nseparate surveys: The Grain Stocks Report and the Crops APS Survey.\n \nThe pilot study outlined in this report had three primary objectives. The first objective was to \ndelineate and assess new outreach, communication, and engagement activities tested during the \nDecember 2022 and March 2023 GSR quarterly survey. The second objective was to determine \nthe feasibility of the study and assess its applicability to the entire GSR survey sample, given \nlimited available resources. The third objective was to create an initial framework for a flexible \noutreach plan and an assessment tool that could be customized as necessary. The assessment tool \nwould adhere to the standards of impact evaluation, a method that examines how the outcomes of \ninterventions (such as outreach and engagement activities) are influenced and whether these \neffects are intentional or unintentional. Impact evaluations assess the effectiveness of a program \nand are commonly applied to evaluate design innovations. In contrast to monitoring, impact \nevaluations concentrate on enhancing implementation, reducing costs, and informing \nstakeholders about the efficacy of the outreach program.  \nConcentrating on new communication and engagement activities in Missouri and Illinois referred \nto as the Heartland Region by NASS, the pilot study evaluated applications, benefits, and \nlimitations of outreach activities. The goal is to offer insights applicable on the national level and \naid in the design of a targeted outreach program to enhance awareness, utilization of NASS data \ntools, web services, and potentially increase response.",

One focused on the GSR webpage redesign, while the other highlighted \nthe advantages of registering an eAuthentication account. Each rack card featured a quick-\nresponse (QR) code for convenient access, along with the website URL for recipients who \npreferred not to use the QR code or were unable to do so. QR codes are a type of barcode that \nstores information, such as a website link, to provide quick access through a digital camera.  \nThe primary objective of this pilot study is to look at the feasibility of expanding the study at a \nnational level. The study design was not set up to conduct statistical analysis; therefore, \ndescriptive statistics are used to explain the findings. Results indicate that a targeted outreach \nprogram specific to the survey can effectively engage respondents, foster conversations, create \npartnerships, gather input for GSR webpage improvement, and inform respondents about new \nsurvey completion tools. Modifications were made to the QR code instructions for the March \n2023 GSR survey. Upon introducing more detailed instructions on the rack cards, an uptick in \nQR scans was observed. However, establishing clear correlations between the rack cards, QR \ncodes, and URLs leading to the GSR webpage proved challenging. It is plausible that recipients \nof the rack cards accessed the webpage by manually entering the URL or utilizing a saved link. \nWhile the surge in webpage visits indicates respondents are interested in engaging with the GSR \nwebpage, it suggests a potential need for more interactive features on the GSR webpage.  \nIn summary, the researchers wanted to understand strategies to encourage survey response and \nimprove response rates through outreach and engagement activities. Engaging in meaningful \nconversations with operations, cultivating partnerships, and gathering valuable input, as observed \nin this research, contributed to increased engagement. The development of assessment tools and \na structured framework serves to bolster outreach and engagement strategies.

The main objective of implementing targeted outreach, \ncommunication, and engagement activities within the GSR  is to establish a \nfoundation for a customizable outreach plan and assessment tool  that are  \nadaptable as needed. The creation of a survey-specific outreach program with \nfocused activities that utilize rack cards and Quick Response ( QR) codes \nallows researchers to assess effectiveness within targeted activities. The \nresearch emphasizes the survey program requirements  and considers the \nconstraints associated with specific outreach approaches. During a pilot study \non the GSR , we observed increased engagement following the incorporation \nof additional outreach and engagement activities. However, assessing the long-\nterm outcomes of these initiatives remains premature. The findings will inform \nthe design of future studies on the GSR outreach and engagement strategies.  \nMaintaining the engagement of both new and existing respondents remains an \nongoing challenge for the GSR, making outreach and engagement particularly \nchallenging. \n \n \n1. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND \n \nThe Grain Stocks publication is composed of quarterly surveys that provide detailed \nestimates of grains, oilseeds, and pulse crops stored in any commercial facility off the farm. \nThe Grain Stocks publication includes information collected from two separate surveys: The \nGrain Stocks Report (GSR) and the Crops Acreage, Production, and Stocks (Crops APS) \nSurvey. The GSR is conducted quarterly with reference dates of March 1, June 1, September \n1, and December 1. The Crops APS Survey is conducted at the same time as the GSR and \ncollects information on on-farm grain stocks. The Crops APS Survey also collects acreage, \nyield, and production data for various crops each quarter. These surveys are conducted in \nevery state and measure stocks of barley, canola, corn, flaxseed, mustard seed, oats, rapeseed, \nsafflower, sorghum, soybeans, sunflowers, and wheat. Estimates for grains, oilseeds, and \npulse crops from the GSR are combined with on-farm stocks estimates from the Crops APS \nSurvey and published in the Grain Stocks publication.",

    "page_content": "6 \n \n \n \nThe target population is all entities in the United States that can store at least 1,000 bushels of \ngrain (e.g., elevators, grain and oilseed processing plants, terminals, and any other facilities \nthat store grain or oilseeds, excluding peanuts and rice) off the farm. The sampling frame is \ngrouped into specialty and non-specialty operations and stratified using off farm grain \nstorage capacity as a measure of size. For more information on the methodology on surveys \nused in the Grain Stocks publication, please see: Grain Stocks Methodology and Quality \nMeasures.  \nIn 2020, a technical evaluation of the GSR revealed a diminished level of response through \nthe web in contrast to phone or mail. At the start of each quarterly survey, pre-survey letters \nare sent to respondents with instructions on how to complete the survey; however, the letter \ndoes not include the survey website. This disparity may be attributed to a low percentage of \nvisitors to the GSR webpage, indicating that respondents may not be utilizing available web \nresponse tools. The primary goal of the NASS survey webpages is to educate the public \nabout NASS survey programs. The intended audience for NASS survey webpages typically \nincludes: the media, those sampled to respond to the survey, stakeholders, trade partners, and \nother interested parties. All NASS survey webpages provide a link and information on how \nto respond to the survey via the web using a respondent portal. The analytics of the GSR \nwebpage also showed visitors spent less time on the GSR survey webpage as opposed to \nother similar survey webpages with a lower percentage of visitors. In response to these \nchallenges, the GSR Outreach Team was formed to explore improved strategies for outreach, \nengagement, and delivering pertinent survey information to respondents regarding the GSR. \nA pilot study was conducted to describe and assess new outreach, communication, and \nengagement activities exclusively implemented in Illinois and Missouri within the Heartland \nRegion during the December 2022 and March 2023 quarterly GSR. At the time of this study, \nNASS operated twelve regional field offices nationwide (Appendix A), each tasked with \noverseeing implementation of the GSR. The study entails an exploration of the potential \napplications, benefits, and limitations associated with the deployment of these outreach and \nengagement activities. The goal of this research was to contribute a preliminary \nunderstanding of evaluating outreach and engagement that can be applicable to the GSR at a \nnational level. Additionally, it aims to assist in designing an outreach program and activities \nthat enhance awareness, such as the utilization of NASS data tools on the NASS website, \nincreased visitation to NASS survey webpages, increased use of the eAuthorization webpage, \nand the eventual creation of an evaluation tool to measure the success of new outreach and \nengagement activities.  \nThis report is organized into 5 sections: 1) Introduction and Background; 2) Methods - \nCurrent outreach activities and new outreach activities; 3) Results; 4) Conclusions and \nRecommendations; and 5) Limitations of the evaluation of outreach and engagement \nactivities.",

    "page_content": "7 \n \n1.1 Common Outreach and Engagement Activities at other Federal Agencies  \nSeveral members from the GSR Outreach Team met with other federal statistical agencies to \nassess how they were engaging in survey outreach. The Outreach Sub-team met with staff \nfrom the Census Bureau and the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) to discuss the use of \nQuick Response (QR) codes, infographics, and other common outreach and engagement \nactivities. The Census Bureau and the BEA shared an overview of the outreach and \nengagement methods they presently employ to enhance participation. The conversation \ndelved into the utilization of QR codes and their application in engagement activities, as well \nas the strategies for obtaining metrics for various initiatives.  \n \n1.2 Overview of Public Outreach Programs and Outreach Activities  \nEngagement with the farming population - already a challenging demographic to reach - \nbecomes even more complex when disseminating information to businesses encompassing \noff-farm grain storage, including elevators, merchant mills, etc., falling under the GSR \n(Freimuth et al 1990). By integrating strategies that foster participation within the off-farm \ngrain storage community and soliciting their input in decision-making regarding preferred \ncommunication methods, we can bolster our ability to establish connections and strengthen \nour partnership with the GSR program (Wiatrowski, 2008; Nguyen et al 2019; Freimuth et al \n1990). Four outreach and engagement methods and strategies were identified as necessary for \naddressing the primary research objectives while also establishing the initial framework for a \ncustomizable outreach and assessment plan. These are public outreach, outreach activities, \nand community engagement.  \nPublic outreach is a general term used to describe a variety of activities by a program to \npromote public awareness and understanding of a program (De Weger, E., Van Vooren, N., \nLuijkx, K.G. et al. 2018; Harrison et al 2009). Throughout this report, the term “outreach \nprogram(s)” is used to describe a specific type of public outreach. An outreach program \ngenerally targets participants or potential participants of a program that requires outreach \nactivities to promote engagement and participation in the program’s services. Generally, \noutreach programs are detailed documents that contain the goals of the outreach, the intended \naudience (who will receive the information and who matters to the research), and a detailed \ncollaboration plan with current and/or future partners (Cruickshank & Nowak, 2001; Levine-\nClark & Carter, 2013; McCown et 2011; Sapienza et al 2007). Once an outreach plan is \ncreated, evaluations on outreach activities should occur regularly to ensure goals are being \nmet and change activities that are producing poor results.\n \nOutreach activities are embedded in the outreach program and occur throughout the year to \npromote and provide access to the program’s services (Riesch et al. 2013). Outreach \nactivities are typically one-way communications designed to increase awareness and \neducation about the program. Activities will often consist of newsletters, social media posts, \nand other marketing tactics that allow the recipient to passively receive the information. \nThese activities are used to identify existing problems or challenges within the program and",

    "page_content": "8 \n \nto increase services participation and engagement (McCown et al 2011; Riesch et al. 2013; \nSapienza et al 2007). Outreach activities are generally short-term as they are meant to be \nbroad promotion of the program.  \nCommunity Engagement is a type of outreach activity; however, it is a more active method of \nimplementing change (De Weger, E., Van Vooren, N., Luijkx, K.G. et al. 2018; McCown et \nal 2011). Engagement is based on creating and sustaining relationships that are built and \nmaintained over time. Community engagement is a two-way communication or activity \nwhere the recipient provides inputs and becomes a part of the program process. Activities \nconsist of forums, web-based feedback, community-based committees, and interactive web \nprograms where the user can actively participate in the process of the program (McCown et \nal 2011; Bureau of Economic Analysis 2022). Community engagement activities are meant \nto be long-term activities that are relationship building and beneficial to the community.  \n \n2. METHODS \n2.1 Pilot Study Target Population - Heartland Region GSR Respondents  \n \nIn the planning phase of the pilot study, a comprehensive review was conducted for each \nNASS-assigned region to assess the potential engagement of outreach target activities during \nthe study. Illinois and Missouri, the two states in the Heartland Region, were selected to \nparticipate in the study. States in the Heartland Region were selected for several reasons. \nFirst, the distribution of grain elevators and the percentage of corn, soybeans, and wheat \ngrowers are more evenly spread compared to other regions. Second, the region has single \nelevators that typically report through hard copy mail returns, while multi-unit operations \nfacilities are reporting both through mail and via the internet.  \n \n2.2 Outreach Activities for the GSR  \n \nCurrently NASS employs outreach (marketing) initiatives to encourage response to survey \nprograms. Public outreach efforts for the GSR prior to the experiment included a public \nwebpage with information about the GSR, pre-survey letter, some social media postings \nabout the GSR, tradeshow participation, field outreach efforts by state statisticians and \nregional staff, and partner outreach (newsletter, email, calls, etc.). The public webpage for \nGSR provides information on the surveys in the Grain Stocks Report and links to access the \nquarterly reports from data acquired during each GSR survey cycle.  \n \nThe pre-survey letter for GSR was sent to respondents to remind them of the reasons why \ncompleting the GSR is important and the different ways to complete the survey. In addition, \nseveral social media posts were made to X (formerly Twitter) to promote and encourage \nrespondents to complete the GSR survey. For the December 2022 data collection, the X \nsocial media posts were made on 12/13/2022 (Figure 1) and 12/16/2022 (Figure 2). Images",

The objective of outreach and engagement activities \nfor this study was to explain the benefits of responding to the GSR request, introduce new \nweb tools, and create new levels of engagement with GSR respondents. For the purposes of \nthis research, each activity was evaluated to assess its impact on GSR respondents against its \nintended objective. \nTo inform an outreach program for potential respondents of the GSR survey, we conducted \nthree new outreach and engagement activities: 1) rack cards to encourage visiting the GSR \nwebpage or signing up for eAuthorization account with the option of using the URL or QR \ncodes for easy access; 2) a redesign of the GSR webpage, and 3) a feedback survey to \nencourage visitors to provide feedback on data and information they would like to see on the \nwebpage. The rack cards are an engagement/outreach activity, QR codes are engagement \nactivity, website redesign and feedback survey are also engagement activities.

The Outreach Team and \nNASS’s Public Affairs Office (PAO) collaboratively opted to design two racks cards: one \nfocusing on a GSR web push campaign and another promoting creating eAuthentication \nlogin and its benefits. The GSR web campaign card provided information on the latest \nfeatures of the GSR webpage, such as data visualizations, a crop progress map, and grain \nstocks videos. The second rack card aimed to educate respondents about the advantages of \ncreating an eAuthentication account. An eAuthentication (eAuth) is the system used by \nUSDA agencies such as NASS for customers to obtain accounts that will provide them \naccess to USDA/NASS web applications and services, including the NASS respondent \nportal. The benefits of using eAuth include completing surveys without a survey code, access \nto multiple USDA web applications, and the ability to view prior completed surveys.  \n \nThe rack cards served a dual purpose as the Outreach Team aimed to assess whether sending \nthem to respondents would either increase engagement with the GSR survey and/or provide \nan alternative to survey responses (web response), which might be a more convenient option \nfor businesses.  \n \nOnce a draft of the rack card was prepared by PAO, it was shared with the Outreach Team \nfor their initial review. During the weekly team meetings, the initial draft was reviewed \nthoroughly, and feedback was provided. After finalizing the rack cards, they were sent out \nalong with the pre-survey letter and questionnaire during the December 2022 and March \n2023 quarterly surveys.

RESULTS \n3.1 Response Rates \n3.1.1 Overall Response Rates for the Heartland Region  \nOne of the main goals of engaging in outreach is to increase the visibility of the survey and \nencourage survey responses. To help examine the efficacy of outreach efforts, the response \nrates for the GSR were examined. The survey response rates during the December 2022 and \nMarch 2023 data collections for the Heartland Region were compared to the previous year’s \ndata collections. The prior years response rates were used as a comparison group as no \nadditional outreach efforts or mailings were conducted in any of the states in the region \nduring that time. Please note that these comparisons have not been evaluated for statistical \nsignificance. For the December 2022 data collection in the Heartland Region, the 2021 \nresponse rate was 79.8% and the 2022 response rate was 80.4%. The change in response rate \nfor the December data collection was an increase of +0.7% (December 2022 GSR Board \nReport). For the March 2023 data collection, the 2022 response rate was 78.8% and the 2023 \nresponse rate was 79.1%, an increase of +0.3% (March 2023 GSR Board Report).   \nBoth data collection periods saw an increase in responses from the previous year’s data \ncollection when the outreach strategies were being conducted, which included the marketing \ninsert mailing. While we cannot definitively say that the increase in response rates for the \nHeartland Region was solely due to outreach strategies that were conducted, any increase in \nsurvey response rates is important to note.  \n \n3.1.2 Overall Response Rates of the December 2022 Experiment  \nThe summary results for the December 2022 experiment are presented initially, followed by \nthe outcomes of the second experiment in March 2023. In the December 2022 experiment, \n301 respondents participated in the experiment, receiving one of two versions of the rack \ncard or they were part of the control group. \nTable 2 illustrates the comparisons among treatment groups and between groups, based on \nrespondents who completed the survey and those who did not.

The most probable, yet unverified, \ncause may be attributed to two reasons. First, the respondents may be experiencing what is \ncommonly known as Ad Fatigue, where repeated exposure to campaigns leads to overexposure, \ndiminishing the respondent’s interest (Uzzo, 2020). Another plausible explanation for this \noccurrence could be that respondents received the request in the beginning of farming season, \nrendering them unable to allocate additional time to engage with outreach materials.

With these changes, a higher \nincrease in feedback or recommendation for changes that would benefit the visitor to the site \nmay be observed. \n \n4. CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS \n \nImproving efficacy of engaging respondents can be achieved by creating a tailored outreach \nprogram with activities specifically designed for each survey. This approach facilitates \nmeaningful conversations with operations, fosters partnerships, collects valuable input for \nimproving the GSR survey webpage, and informs respondents about new tools available for \nsurvey completion. When campaign cards were changed to include more detailed instructions, \nan increase in QR code scans did occur; however, we could not find clear relationships between \nthe rack cards, QR codes, and URLs linking to the GSR webpage. Recipients of the rack cards \nmay have typed in the URL or used a saved link to access the webpage. The increase in \nwebpage visits does show the respondents are interested in engaging with the GSR webpage , \nbut may require more engaging features on the webpage. If the GSR survey continued mailing \ncampaigns in addition to including these materials for in- person outreach events, we should \nsee further involvement from operators and receive information on what tools and information \nwill be beneficial to them. Throughout the study , the O utreach Team assumed repeated \nexposure to new products would encourage repeat ed visits to the GS R webpage or further \nexploration of eAuth benefits, etc . (Hekkert et al. 2013) . What we discovered was a repeated \nexposure to new outreach products did not increase visibility to the GSR survey webpage or \nQR code scans.  \n \nThe summary statistics of both December 2022 and March 2023 treatment groups did not \nappear to reveal any notable differences. It is important to note that the research’s primary \nobjective was not to look for statistically significant differences but to explore the feasibility \nof expanding outreach efforts. The research aimed to utilize a small sample size for the \ndevelopment of outreach activities and the creation of an evaluation assessment tool. This \nmethod was designed to ultimately enhance the success of survey programs by providing \nrespondents with simplified response methods and relevant survey information. Looking at \nthe descriptive statistics between December 2021 and December 2022 as well as March 2022 \nand March 2023, a slight decrease in the response rate was observed when comparing the \nDecember 2022 and March 2023 experiment groups, but this was not tested for statistical \nsignificance.",

    "page_content": "32 \n \n \n \nThe study suggests the introduction of new outreach materials may have a positive impact. \nThe absence of a noticeable increase in the March 2023 results aligns with our earlier \nobservations as mentioned in the preceding paragraph. It reinforces the notion that repeated \nexposure to new outreach materials with no immediate changes did not enhance visibility for \neither the GSR survey webpage or QR code scans. The limitations of the research hindered a \nmore comprehensive explanation of this phenomenon and are addressed in Section 5.  \nTo help improve the respondent experience and gain more information about whether current \npromotion and public awareness efforts are being successful, we recommend a Response \nAnalysis Survey (RAS) and a Nonresponse Analysis Survey (NRAS) with respondents and \nnonrespondents, respectively, as follow-up surveys to a future GSR survey. The cost \nassociated with this data collection effort would be relatively small, as it would be conducted \nthrough an online survey platform, Qualtrics.  \nNASS has previously conducted nonresponse analyses to gain a better understanding of \nsurvey nonresponse and aid in determining what areas in the data collection process need \nimprovement (including promotion and/or public awareness). These analyses studied the \nFarm Costs and Returns Survey (FCRS), a predecessor to Agricultural Resource \nManagement Survey (ARMS) with many overlapping topic areas (O’Connor, 1991; \nO’Connor, 1992), and ARMS 3 (Gerling et al., 2008). More recently, response and non-\nresponse analysis was conducted on ARMS 2, focusing on the experiences of not just non-\nresponders but on why respondents chose to answer a survey (Herrell and Van Horn, 2023). \nThe benefit of conducting both response and non-response analysis in surveys is that it \nallows the motivating factors behind operator behaviors, including perceptions on the \nusefulness of the data, marketing materials, and influences on future survey response \nbehaviors, to be identified.  \nBased on these findings, the following changes are recommended:  \nShort Term Recommendations  \n1. Expand testing of outreach informational materials to the GSR in FY24.  \n \na. Establish a uniform format for future survey informational materials incorporating \nQR codes and/or rack cards.  \n \nb. Continue assessing the efficacy of these informational materials.  \n \nc. Establish effective partnerships that have connections and credibility with elevators \nand operators surveyed in the GSR.",

LIMITATIONS OF THE EVALUATION OF OUTREACH AND ENGAGEMENT \nACTIVITIES  \n \nWhile the research fulfilled the requirements for a qualitative pilot study, it fell short of \nmeeting the researchers’ expectations on various fronts. The limited sample size in this initial \nendeavor restricted insights into respondent and stakeholder behaviors when exposed to new \nengagement and outreach materials. Participants in the sample received identical rack cards \nfor both the December 2022 and March 2023 experiments. It is crucial to emphasize that with \nthe research design and the small sample size, this pilot did not allow for statistical testing, \nbut if an experiment is designed for the entire GSR sample on a national level such testing \ncould be conducted.  \nChallenges arose in collecting analytics and assessing new engagement activities on the \nNASS and eAuthentication webpages.",

    "page_content": "34 \n \n \nIntegration issues persisted, particularly with the eAuthentication website, which is managed \nby the USDA rather than NASS. Consequently, tracking changes in site visitors or eAuth \nsignups related to the QR code on the eAuthentication rack card proved unfeasible. \nAdditionally, the research was unable to isolate NASS employees who used the NASS survey \nwebpages during the December and March evaluations. The analytics programs used could \nnot separate NASS employee's webpage visits who may be located outside of Washington, \nD.C headquarters from a non-employee visitor.  \nFurthermore, the analytics from Siteimprove required setting up a Siteimprove campaign for \neach website URL in order to capture detailed information. This means that we did not \ncapture users and behaviors for any variations of the GSR webpage address that may have \nbeen used. Future research should better account for additional variations on the GSR \nwebpage address to get a more complete understanding of user's interactions with the site. \nFor example, ideally, we would want to capture variations such as: \nhttps://www.nass.usda.gov/Surveys/Guide_to_NASS_Surveys/Off-\nFarm_Grain_Stocks/index.php as well as   \nhttps://www.nass.usda.gov/Surveys/Guide_to_NASS_Surveys/Off-Farm_Grain_Stocks/.    \nAnother compromise in the research involved conducting a pilot study to reduce costs, with \nthe intent to implement a fully developed outreach and impact evaluation tool for the GSR \nthe following year. Since the research will not be implemented on a national level for the \nGSR, the development of a prospective impact evaluation template, applicable universally \nacross all NASS surveys, could not be fully conceptualized. Ultimately, the research can only \nyield results specific to the new engagement activities and lacks the capacity for a universal \napplication of impact evaluations to NASS survey outreach endeavors.  \nThe small sample size of this initial effort gave the research a limited but useful insight into \nrespondent and stakeholders behaviors when provided new engagement and outreach \nmaterials. Future studies should include a more robust experimental design expanded beyond \ntwo states to be able to produce more generalizable results. The respondents included in the \nsample for this research received the same rack cards for both the December 2022 and March \n2023 quarterly survey.  \nAttempts were made to gather user feedback on the GSR webpage by creating a feedback \nform. A limitation of this feedback form was that it was static, and users had to click an \nadditional button to be prompted to provide feedback. This is different than how most of the \nfeedback is gathered across the NASS website. Future research should look at alternative \nways to gather user feedback, especially given only one feedback response was received. \nFuture research could look to have better integration with existing feedback surveys that are \ncurrently being conducted on the NASS website.  \nDespite these limitations, the research did reflect engaging the GSR respondent community \nwas effective, even on a small scale. Ongoing research at the national level for the GSR may \nprovide a better understanding of how to target respondents for outreach programs that",

Visitors to these \nwebpages can find comprehensive information about the surveys, instructions and a link to web \nresponse, and other relevant materials. In 2020, NASS received valuable feedback from key data \nusers concerning estimates related to grains and oilseeds storage. In response to this input, a \ntechnical review was initiated to evaluate both the quarterly-conducted Crops Acreage, \nProduction, and Stocks (Crops APS) Survey and the Grain Stocks Report (GSR), which serve as \nthe basis for producing quarterly Grain Stocks publications. Following the research, a \nrecommendation was made to establish a team to tackle the challenge of improving response \nrates through enhanced outreach and engagement efforts (Ridolfo et al. 2021). The GSR \nOutreach Team was formed with the objective of refining strategies for outreach, engagement, \nand the effective communication of survey information exclusively to GSR respondents.  \nUpon evaluating the GSR, the Outreach Team identified a lower level of response for web \nsubmissions compared to phone or email methods. Despite providing a link and relevant \ninformation for web responses on the GSR webpage, analytics indicated decreased engagement \non the GSR webpage in comparison to other survey webpages. The GSR webpage provides \ninformation on the Grain Stocks publication, which includes information collected from the two \nseparate surveys: The Grain Stocks Report and the Crops APS Survey.\n \nThe pilot study outlined in this report had three primary objectives. The first objective was to \ndelineate and assess new outreach, communication, and engagement activities tested during the \nDecember 2022 and March 2023 GSR quarterly survey. The second objective was to determine \nthe feasibility of the study and assess its applicability to the entire GSR survey sample, given \nlimited available resources. The third objective was to create an initial framework for a flexible \noutreach plan and an assessment tool that could be customized as necessary. The assessment tool \nwould adhere to the standards of impact evaluation, a method that examines how the outcomes of \ninterventions (such as outreach and engagement activities) are influenced and whether these \neffects are intentional or unintentional. Impact evaluations assess the effectiveness of a program \nand are commonly applied to evaluate design innovations. In contrast to monitoring, impact \nevaluations concentrate on enhancing implementation, reducing costs, and informing \nstakeholders about the efficacy of the outreach program.  \nConcentrating on new communication and engagement activities in Missouri and Illinois referred \nto as the Heartland Region by NASS, the pilot study evaluated applications, benefits, and \nlimitations of outreach activities. The goal is to offer insights applicable on the national level and \naid in the design of a targeted outreach program to enhance awareness, utilization of NASS data \ntools, web services, and potentially increase response.",

One focused on the GSR webpage redesign, while the other highlighted \nthe advantages of registering an eAuthentication account. Each rack card featured a quick-\nresponse (QR) code for convenient access, along with the website URL for recipients who \npreferred not to use the QR code or were unable to do so. QR codes are a type of barcode that \nstores information, such as a website link, to provide quick access through a digital camera.  \nThe primary objective of this pilot study is to look at the feasibility of expanding the study at a \nnational level. The study design was not set up to conduct statistical analysis; therefore, \ndescriptive statistics are used to explain the findings. Results indicate that a targeted outreach \nprogram specific to the survey can effectively engage respondents, foster conversations, create \npartnerships, gather input for GSR webpage improvement, and inform respondents about new \nsurvey completion tools. Modifications were made to the QR code instructions for the March \n2023 GSR survey. Upon introducing more detailed instructions on the rack cards, an uptick in \nQR scans was observed. However, establishing clear correlations between the rack cards, QR \ncodes, and URLs leading to the GSR webpage proved challenging. It is plausible that recipients \nof the rack cards accessed the webpage by manually entering the URL or utilizing a saved link. \nWhile the surge in webpage visits indicates respondents are interested in engaging with the GSR \nwebpage, it suggests a potential need for more interactive features on the GSR webpage.  \nIn summary, the researchers wanted to understand strategies to encourage survey response and \nimprove response rates through outreach and engagement activities. Engaging in meaningful \nconversations with operations, cultivating partnerships, and gathering valuable input, as observed \nin this research, contributed to increased engagement. The development of assessment tools and \na structured framework serves to bolster outreach and engagement strategies.

The main objective of implementing targeted outreach, \ncommunication, and engagement activities within the GSR  is to establish a \nfoundation for a customizable outreach plan and assessment tool  that are  \nadaptable as needed. The creation of a survey-specific outreach program with \nfocused activities that utilize rack cards and Quick Response ( QR) codes \nallows researchers to assess effectiveness within targeted activities. The \nresearch emphasizes the survey program requirements  and considers the \nconstraints associated with specific outreach approaches. During a pilot study \non the GSR , we observed increased engagement following the incorporation \nof additional outreach and engagement activities. However, assessing the long-\nterm outcomes of these initiatives remains premature. The findings will inform \nthe design of future studies on the GSR outreach and engagement strategies.  \nMaintaining the engagement of both new and existing respondents remains an \nongoing challenge for the GSR, making outreach and engagement particularly \nchallenging. \n \n \n1. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND \n \nThe Grain Stocks publication is composed of quarterly surveys that provide detailed \nestimates of grains, oilseeds, and pulse crops stored in any commercial facility off the farm. \nThe Grain Stocks publication includes information collected from two separate surveys: The \nGrain Stocks Report (GSR) and the Crops Acreage, Production, and Stocks (Crops APS) \nSurvey. The GSR is conducted quarterly with reference dates of March 1, June 1, September \n1, and December 1. The Crops APS Survey is conducted at the same time as the GSR and \ncollects information on on-farm grain stocks. The Crops APS Survey also collects acreage, \nyield, and production data for various crops each quarter. These surveys are conducted in \nevery state and measure stocks of barley, canola, corn, flaxseed, mustard seed, oats, rapeseed, \nsafflower, sorghum, soybeans, sunflowers, and wheat. Estimates for grains, oilseeds, and \npulse crops from the GSR are combined with on-farm stocks estimates from the Crops APS \nSurvey and published in the Grain Stocks publication.",

    "page_content": "6 \n \n \n \nThe target population is all entities in the United States that can store at least 1,000 bushels of \ngrain (e.g., elevators, grain and oilseed processing plants, terminals, and any other facilities \nthat store grain or oilseeds, excluding peanuts and rice) off the farm. The sampling frame is \ngrouped into specialty and non-specialty operations and stratified using off farm grain \nstorage capacity as a measure of size. For more information on the methodology on surveys \nused in the Grain Stocks publication, please see: Grain Stocks Methodology and Quality \nMeasures.  \nIn 2020, a technical evaluation of the GSR revealed a diminished level of response through \nthe web in contrast to phone or mail. At the start of each quarterly survey, pre-survey letters \nare sent to respondents with instructions on how to complete the survey; however, the letter \ndoes not include the survey website. This disparity may be attributed to a low percentage of \nvisitors to the GSR webpage, indicating that respondents may not be utilizing available web \nresponse tools. The primary goal of the NASS survey webpages is to educate the public \nabout NASS survey programs. The intended audience for NASS survey webpages typically \nincludes: the media, those sampled to respond to the survey, stakeholders, trade partners, and \nother interested parties. All NASS survey webpages provide a link and information on how \nto respond to the survey via the web using a respondent portal. The analytics of the GSR \nwebpage also showed visitors spent less time on the GSR survey webpage as opposed to \nother similar survey webpages with a lower percentage of visitors. In response to these \nchallenges, the GSR Outreach Team was formed to explore improved strategies for outreach, \nengagement, and delivering pertinent survey information to respondents regarding the GSR. \nA pilot study was conducted to describe and assess new outreach, communication, and \nengagement activities exclusively implemented in Illinois and Missouri within the Heartland \nRegion during the December 2022 and March 2023 quarterly GSR. At the time of this study, \nNASS operated twelve regional field offices nationwide (Appendix A), each tasked with \noverseeing implementation of the GSR. The study entails an exploration of the potential \napplications, benefits, and limitations associated with the deployment of these outreach and \nengagement activities. The goal of this research was to contribute a preliminary \nunderstanding of evaluating outreach and engagement that can be applicable to the GSR at a \nnational level. Additionally, it aims to assist in designing an outreach program and activities \nthat enhance awareness, such as the utilization of NASS data tools on the NASS website, \nincreased visitation to NASS survey webpages, increased use of the eAuthorization webpage, \nand the eventual creation of an evaluation tool to measure the success of new outreach and \nengagement activities.  \nThis report is organized into 5 sections: 1) Introduction and Background; 2) Methods - \nCurrent outreach activities and new outreach activities; 3) Results; 4) Conclusions and \nRecommendations; and 5) Limitations of the evaluation of outreach and engagement \nactivities.",

    "page_content": "7 \n \n1.1 Common Outreach and Engagement Activities at other Federal Agencies  \nSeveral members from the GSR Outreach Team met with other federal statistical agencies to \nassess how they were engaging in survey outreach. The Outreach Sub-team met with staff \nfrom the Census Bureau and the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) to discuss the use of \nQuick Response (QR) codes, infographics, and other common outreach and engagement \nactivities. The Census Bureau and the BEA shared an overview of the outreach and \nengagement methods they presently employ to enhance participation. The conversation \ndelved into the utilization of QR codes and their application in engagement activities, as well \nas the strategies for obtaining metrics for various initiatives.  \n \n1.2 Overview of Public Outreach Programs and Outreach Activities  \nEngagement with the farming population - already a challenging demographic to reach - \nbecomes even more complex when disseminating information to businesses encompassing \noff-farm grain storage, including elevators, merchant mills, etc., falling under the GSR \n(Freimuth et al 1990). By integrating strategies that foster participation within the off-farm \ngrain storage community and soliciting their input in decision-making regarding preferred \ncommunication methods, we can bolster our ability to establish connections and strengthen \nour partnership with the GSR program (Wiatrowski, 2008; Nguyen et al 2019; Freimuth et al \n1990). Four outreach and engagement methods and strategies were identified as necessary for \naddressing the primary research objectives while also establishing the initial framework for a \ncustomizable outreach and assessment plan. These are public outreach, outreach activities, \nand community engagement.  \nPublic outreach is a general term used to describe a variety of activities by a program to \npromote public awareness and understanding of a program (De Weger, E., Van Vooren, N., \nLuijkx, K.G. et al. 2018; Harrison et al 2009). Throughout this report, the term “outreach \nprogram(s)” is used to describe a specific type of public outreach. An outreach program \ngenerally targets participants or potential participants of a program that requires outreach \nactivities to promote engagement and participation in the program’s services. Generally, \noutreach programs are detailed documents that contain the goals of the outreach, the intended \naudience (who will receive the information and who matters to the research), and a detailed \ncollaboration plan with current and/or future partners (Cruickshank & Nowak, 2001; Levine-\nClark & Carter, 2013; McCown et 2011; Sapienza et al 2007). Once an outreach plan is \ncreated, evaluations on outreach activities should occur regularly to ensure goals are being \nmet and change activities that are producing poor results.\n \nOutreach activities are embedded in the outreach program and occur throughout the year to \npromote and provide access to the program’s services (Riesch et al. 2013). Outreach \nactivities are typically one-way communications designed to increase awareness and \neducation about the program. Activities will often consist of newsletters, social media posts, \nand other marketing tactics that allow the recipient to passively receive the information. \nThese activities are used to identify existing problems or challenges within the program and",

    "page_content": "8 \n \nto increase services participation and engagement (McCown et al 2011; Riesch et al. 2013; \nSapienza et al 2007). Outreach activities are generally short-term as they are meant to be \nbroad promotion of the program.  \nCommunity Engagement is a type of outreach activity; however, it is a more active method of \nimplementing change (De Weger, E., Van Vooren, N., Luijkx, K.G. et al. 2018; McCown et \nal 2011). Engagement is based on creating and sustaining relationships that are built and \nmaintained over time. Community engagement is a two-way communication or activity \nwhere the recipient provides inputs and becomes a part of the program process. Activities \nconsist of forums, web-based feedback, community-based committees, and interactive web \nprograms where the user can actively participate in the process of the program (McCown et \nal 2011; Bureau of Economic Analysis 2022). Community engagement activities are meant \nto be long-term activities that are relationship building and beneficial to the community.  \n \n2. METHODS \n2.1 Pilot Study Target Population - Heartland Region GSR Respondents  \n \nIn the planning phase of the pilot study, a comprehensive review was conducted for each \nNASS-assigned region to assess the potential engagement of outreach target activities during \nthe study. Illinois and Missouri, the two states in the Heartland Region, were selected to \nparticipate in the study. States in the Heartland Region were selected for several reasons. \nFirst, the distribution of grain elevators and the percentage of corn, soybeans, and wheat \ngrowers are more evenly spread compared to other regions. Second, the region has single \nelevators that typically report through hard copy mail returns, while multi-unit operations \nfacilities are reporting both through mail and via the internet.  \n \n2.2 Outreach Activities for the GSR  \n \nCurrently NASS employs outreach (marketing) initiatives to encourage response to survey \nprograms. Public outreach efforts for the GSR prior to the experiment included a public \nwebpage with information about the GSR, pre-survey letter, some social media postings \nabout the GSR, tradeshow participation, field outreach efforts by state statisticians and \nregional staff, and partner outreach (newsletter, email, calls, etc.). The public webpage for \nGSR provides information on the surveys in the Grain Stocks Report and links to access the \nquarterly reports from data acquired during each GSR survey cycle.  \n \nThe pre-survey letter for GSR was sent to respondents to remind them of the reasons why \ncompleting the GSR is important and the different ways to complete the survey. In addition, \nseveral social media posts were made to X (formerly Twitter) to promote and encourage \nrespondents to complete the GSR survey. For the December 2022 data collection, the X \nsocial media posts were made on 12/13/2022 (Figure 1) and 12/16/2022 (Figure 2). Images",

The objective of outreach and engagement activities \nfor this study was to explain the benefits of responding to the GSR request, introduce new \nweb tools, and create new levels of engagement with GSR respondents. For the purposes of \nthis research, each activity was evaluated to assess its impact on GSR respondents against its \nintended objective. \nTo inform an outreach program for potential respondents of the GSR survey, we conducted \nthree new outreach and engagement activities: 1) rack cards to encourage visiting the GSR \nwebpage or signing up for eAuthorization account with the option of using the URL or QR \ncodes for easy access; 2) a redesign of the GSR webpage, and 3) a feedback survey to \nencourage visitors to provide feedback on data and information they would like to see on the \nwebpage. The rack cards are an engagement/outreach activity, QR codes are engagement \nactivity, website redesign and feedback survey are also engagement activities.

The Outreach Team and \nNASS’s Public Affairs Office (PAO) collaboratively opted to design two racks cards: one \nfocusing on a GSR web push campaign and another promoting creating eAuthentication \nlogin and its benefits. The GSR web campaign card provided information on the latest \nfeatures of the GSR webpage, such as data visualizations, a crop progress map, and grain \nstocks videos. The second rack card aimed to educate respondents about the advantages of \ncreating an eAuthentication account. An eAuthentication (eAuth) is the system used by \nUSDA agencies such as NASS for customers to obtain accounts that will provide them \naccess to USDA/NASS web applications and services, including the NASS respondent \nportal. The benefits of using eAuth include completing surveys without a survey code, access \nto multiple USDA web applications, and the ability to view prior completed surveys.  \n \nThe rack cards served a dual purpose as the Outreach Team aimed to assess whether sending \nthem to respondents would either increase engagement with the GSR survey and/or provide \nan alternative to survey responses (web response), which might be a more convenient option \nfor businesses.  \n \nOnce a draft of the rack card was prepared by PAO, it was shared with the Outreach Team \nfor their initial review. During the weekly team meetings, the initial draft was reviewed \nthoroughly, and feedback was provided. After finalizing the rack cards, they were sent out \nalong with the pre-survey letter and questionnaire during the December 2022 and March \n2023 quarterly surveys.

RESULTS \n3.1 Response Rates \n3.1.1 Overall Response Rates for the Heartland Region  \nOne of the main goals of engaging in outreach is to increase the visibility of the survey and \nencourage survey responses. To help examine the efficacy of outreach efforts, the response \nrates for the GSR were examined. The survey response rates during the December 2022 and \nMarch 2023 data collections for the Heartland Region were compared to the previous year’s \ndata collections. The prior years response rates were used as a comparison group as no \nadditional outreach efforts or mailings were conducted in any of the states in the region \nduring that time. Please note that these comparisons have not been evaluated for statistical \nsignificance. For the December 2022 data collection in the Heartland Region, the 2021 \nresponse rate was 79.8% and the 2022 response rate was 80.4%.

For the March 2023 data collection, the 2022 response rate was 78.8% and the 2023 \nresponse rate was 79.1%, an increase of +0.3% (March 2023 GSR Board Report).   \nBoth data collection periods saw an increase in responses from the previous year’s data \ncollection when the outreach strategies were being conducted, which included the marketing \ninsert mailing. While we cannot definitively say that the increase in response rates for the \nHeartland Region was solely due to outreach strategies that were conducted, any increase in \nsurvey response rates is important to note.  \n \n3.1.2 Overall Response Rates of the December 2022 Experiment  \nThe summary results for the December 2022 experiment are presented initially, followed by \nthe outcomes of the second experiment in March 2023. In the December 2022 experiment, \n301 respondents participated in the experiment, receiving one of two versions of the rack \ncard or they were part of the control group. \nTable 2 illustrates the comparisons among treatment groups and between groups, based on \nrespondents who completed the survey and those who did not.

First, the respondents may be experiencing what is \ncommonly known as Ad Fatigue, where repeated exposure to campaigns leads to overexposure, \ndiminishing the respondent’s interest (Uzzo, 2020). Another plausible explanation for this \noccurrence could be that respondents received the request in the beginning of farming season, \nrendering them unable to allocate additional time to engage with outreach materials.

Another way to make the \nfeedback survey more visible is to have a pop-up feature that shows the link when the site is \nvisited or modify existing metrics to improve engagement. With these changes, a higher \nincrease in feedback or recommendation for changes that would benefit the visitor to the site \nmay be observed. \n \n4. CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS \n \nImproving efficacy of engaging respondents can be achieved by creating a tailored outreach \nprogram with activities specifically designed for each survey. This approach facilitates \nmeaningful conversations with operations, fosters partnerships, collects valuable input for \nimproving the GSR survey webpage, and informs respondents about new tools available for \nsurvey completion. When campaign cards were changed to include more detailed instructions, \nan increase in QR code scans did occur; however, we could not find clear relationships between \nthe rack cards, QR codes, and URLs linking to the GSR webpage. Recipients of the rack cards \nmay have typed in the URL or used a saved link to access the webpage. The increase in \nwebpage visits does show the respondents are interested in engaging with the GSR webpage , \nbut may require more engaging features on the webpage. If the GSR survey continued mailing \ncampaigns in addition to including these materials for in- person outreach events, we should \nsee further involvement from operators and receive information on what tools and information \nwill be beneficial to them. Throughout the study , the O utreach Team assumed repeated \nexposure to new products would encourage repeat ed visits to the GS R webpage or further \nexploration of eAuth benefits, etc . (Hekkert et al. 2013) . What we discovered was a repeated \nexposure to new outreach products did not increase visibility to the GSR survey webpage or \nQR code scans.  \n \nThe summary statistics of both December 2022 and March 2023 treatment groups did not \nappear to reveal any notable differences. It is important to note that the research’s primary \nobjective was not to look for statistically significant differences but to explore the feasibility \nof expanding outreach efforts. The research aimed to utilize a small sample size for the \ndevelopment of outreach activities and the creation of an evaluation assessment tool. This \nmethod was designed to ultimately enhance the success of survey programs by providing \nrespondents with simplified response methods and relevant survey information. Looking at \nthe descriptive statistics between December 2021 and December 2022 as well as March 2022 \nand March 2023, a slight decrease in the response rate was observed when comparing the \nDecember 2022 and March 2023 experiment groups, but this was not tested for statistical \nsignificance.",

    "page_content": "32 \n \n \n \nThe study suggests the introduction of new outreach materials may have a positive impact. \nThe absence of a noticeable increase in the March 2023 results aligns with our earlier \nobservations as mentioned in the preceding paragraph. It reinforces the notion that repeated \nexposure to new outreach materials with no immediate changes did not enhance visibility for \neither the GSR survey webpage or QR code scans. The limitations of the research hindered a \nmore comprehensive explanation of this phenomenon and are addressed in Section 5.  \nTo help improve the respondent experience and gain more information about whether current \npromotion and public awareness efforts are being successful, we recommend a Response \nAnalysis Survey (RAS) and a Nonresponse Analysis Survey (NRAS) with respondents and \nnonrespondents, respectively, as follow-up surveys to a future GSR survey. The cost \nassociated with this data collection effort would be relatively small, as it would be conducted \nthrough an online survey platform, Qualtrics.  \nNASS has previously conducted nonresponse analyses to gain a better understanding of \nsurvey nonresponse and aid in determining what areas in the data collection process need \nimprovement (including promotion and/or public awareness). These analyses studied the \nFarm Costs and Returns Survey (FCRS), a predecessor to Agricultural Resource \nManagement Survey (ARMS) with many overlapping topic areas (O’Connor, 1991; \nO’Connor, 1992), and ARMS 3 (Gerling et al., 2008). More recently, response and non-\nresponse analysis was conducted on ARMS 2, focusing on the experiences of not just non-\nresponders but on why respondents chose to answer a survey (Herrell and Van Horn, 2023). \nThe benefit of conducting both response and non-response analysis in surveys is that it \nallows the motivating factors behind operator behaviors, including perceptions on the \nusefulness of the data, marketing materials, and influences on future survey response \nbehaviors, to be identified.  \nBased on these findings, the following changes are recommended:  \nShort Term Recommendations  \n1. Expand testing of outreach informational materials to the GSR in FY24.  \n \na. Establish a uniform format for future survey informational materials incorporating \nQR codes and/or rack cards.  \n \nb. Continue assessing the efficacy of these informational materials.  \n \nc.

LIMITATIONS OF THE EVALUATION OF OUTREACH AND ENGAGEMENT \nACTIVITIES  \n \nWhile the research fulfilled the requirements for a qualitative pilot study, it fell short of \nmeeting the researchers’ expectations on various fronts. The limited sample size in this initial \nendeavor restricted insights into respondent and stakeholder behaviors when exposed to new \nengagement and outreach materials. Participants in the sample received identical rack cards \nfor both the December 2022 and March 2023 experiments. It is crucial to emphasize that with \nthe research design and the small sample size, this pilot did not allow for statistical testing, \nbut if an experiment is designed for the entire GSR sample on a national level such testing \ncould be conducted.  \nChallenges arose in collecting analytics and assessing new engagement activities on the \nNASS and eAuthentication webpages.",

    "page_content": "34 \n \n \nIntegration issues persisted, particularly with the eAuthentication website, which is managed \nby the USDA rather than NASS. Consequently, tracking changes in site visitors or eAuth \nsignups related to the QR code on the eAuthentication rack card proved unfeasible. \nAdditionally, the research was unable to isolate NASS employees who used the NASS survey \nwebpages during the December and March evaluations. The analytics programs used could \nnot separate NASS employee's webpage visits who may be located outside of Washington, \nD.C headquarters from a non-employee visitor.  \nFurthermore, the analytics from Siteimprove required setting up a Siteimprove campaign for \neach website URL in order to capture detailed information. This means that we did not \ncapture users and behaviors for any variations of the GSR webpage address that may have \nbeen used. Future research should better account for additional variations on the GSR \nwebpage address to get a more complete understanding of user's interactions with the site. \nFor example, ideally, we would want to capture variations such as: \nhttps://www.nass.usda.gov/Surveys/Guide_to_NASS_Surveys/Off-\nFarm_Grain_Stocks/index.php as well as   \nhttps://www.nass.usda.gov/Surveys/Guide_to_NASS_Surveys/Off-Farm_Grain_Stocks/.    \nAnother compromise in the research involved conducting a pilot study to reduce costs, with \nthe intent to implement a fully developed outreach and impact evaluation tool for the GSR \nthe following year. Since the research will not be implemented on a national level for the \nGSR, the development of a prospective impact evaluation template, applicable universally \nacross all NASS surveys, could not be fully conceptualized. Ultimately, the research can only \nyield results specific to the new engagement activities and lacks the capacity for a universal \napplication of impact evaluations to NASS survey outreach endeavors.  \nThe small sample size of this initial effort gave the research a limited but useful insight into \nrespondent and stakeholders behaviors when provided new engagement and outreach \nmaterials. Future studies should include a more robust experimental design expanded beyond \ntwo states to be able to produce more generalizable results. The respondents included in the \nsample for this research received the same rack cards for both the December 2022 and March \n2023 quarterly survey.  \nAttempts were made to gather user feedback on the GSR webpage by creating a feedback \nform. A limitation of this feedback form was that it was static, and users had to click an \nadditional button to be prompted to provide feedback. This is different than how most of the \nfeedback is gathered across the NASS website. Future research should look at alternative \nways to gather user feedback, especially given only one feedback response was received. \nFuture research could look to have better integration with existing feedback surveys that are \ncurrently being conducted on the NASS website.  \nDespite these limitations, the research did reflect engaging the GSR respondent community \nwas effective, even on a small scale. Ongoing research at the national level for the GSR may \nprovide a better understanding of how to target respondents for outreach programs that",

Visitors to these \nwebpages can find comprehensive information about the surveys, instructions and a link to web \nresponse, and other relevant materials. In 2020, NASS received valuable feedback from key data \nusers concerning estimates related to grains and oilseeds storage. In response to this input, a \ntechnical review was initiated to evaluate both the quarterly-conducted Crops Acreage, \nProduction, and Stocks (Crops APS) Survey and the Grain Stocks Report (GSR), which serve as \nthe basis for producing quarterly Grain Stocks publications. Following the research, a \nrecommendation was made to establish a team to tackle the challenge of improving response \nrates through enhanced outreach and engagement efforts (Ridolfo et al. 2021). The GSR \nOutreach Team was formed with the objective of refining strategies for outreach, engagement, \nand the effective communication of survey information exclusively to GSR respondents.  \nUpon evaluating the GSR, the Outreach Team identified a lower level of response for web \nsubmissions compared to phone or email methods. Despite providing a link and relevant \ninformation for web responses on the GSR webpage, analytics indicated decreased engagement \non the GSR webpage in comparison to other survey webpages. The GSR webpage provides \ninformation on the Grain Stocks publication, which includes information collected from the two \nseparate surveys: The Grain Stocks Report and the Crops APS Survey.\n \nThe pilot study outlined in this report had three primary objectives. The first objective was to \ndelineate and assess new outreach, communication, and engagement activities tested during the \nDecember 2022 and March 2023 GSR quarterly survey. The second objective was to determine \nthe feasibility of the study and assess its applicability to the entire GSR survey sample, given \nlimited available resources. The third objective was to create an initial framework for a flexible \noutreach plan and an assessment tool that could be customized as necessary. The assessment tool \nwould adhere to the standards of impact evaluation, a method that examines how the outcomes of \ninterventions (such as outreach and engagement activities) are influenced and whether these \neffects are intentional or unintentional. Impact evaluations assess the effectiveness of a program \nand are commonly applied to evaluate design innovations. In contrast to monitoring, impact \nevaluations concentrate on enhancing implementation, reducing costs, and informing \nstakeholders about the efficacy of the outreach program.  \nConcentrating on new communication and engagement activities in Missouri and Illinois referred \nto as the Heartland Region by NASS, the pilot study evaluated applications, benefits, and \nlimitations of outreach activities. The goal is to offer insights applicable on the national level and \naid in the design of a targeted outreach program to enhance awareness, utilization of NASS data \ntools, web services, and potentially increase response.",

    "page_content": "2 \n \n \n \nDuring December 2022 and March 2023, a segment of the Heartland Region received one of  \ntwo types of rack cards. One focused on the GSR webpage redesign, while the other highlighted \nthe advantages of registering an eAuthentication account. Each rack card featured a quick-\nresponse (QR) code for convenient access, along with the website URL for recipients who \npreferred not to use the QR code or were unable to do so. QR codes are a type of barcode that \nstores information, such as a website link, to provide quick access through a digital camera.  \nThe primary objective of this pilot study is to look at the feasibility of expanding the study at a \nnational level. The study design was not set up to conduct statistical analysis; therefore, \ndescriptive statistics are used to explain the findings. Results indicate that a targeted outreach \nprogram specific to the survey can effectively engage respondents, foster conversations, create \npartnerships, gather input for GSR webpage improvement, and inform respondents about new \nsurvey completion tools. Modifications were made to the QR code instructions for the March \n2023 GSR survey. Upon introducing more detailed instructions on the rack cards, an uptick in \nQR scans was observed. However, establishing clear correlations between the rack cards, QR \ncodes, and URLs leading to the GSR webpage proved challenging. It is plausible that recipients \nof the rack cards accessed the webpage by manually entering the URL or utilizing a saved link. \nWhile the surge in webpage visits indicates respondents are interested in engaging with the GSR \nwebpage, it suggests a potential need for more interactive features on the GSR webpage.  \nIn summary, the researchers wanted to understand strategies to encourage survey response and \nimprove response rates through outreach and engagement activities. Engaging in meaningful \nconversations with operations, cultivating partnerships, and gathering valuable input, as observed \nin this research, contributed to increased engagement. The development of assessment tools and \na structured framework serves to bolster outreach and engagement strategies.

The main objective of implementing targeted outreach, \ncommunication, and engagement activities within the GSR  is to establish a \nfoundation for a customizable outreach plan and assessment tool  that are  \nadaptable as needed. The creation of a survey-specific outreach program with \nfocused activities that utilize rack cards and Quick Response ( QR) codes \nallows researchers to assess effectiveness within targeted activities. The \nresearch emphasizes the survey program requirements  and considers the \nconstraints associated with specific outreach approaches. During a pilot study \non the GSR , we observed increased engagement following the incorporation \nof additional outreach and engagement activities. However, assessing the long-\nterm outcomes of these initiatives remains premature. The findings will inform \nthe design of future studies on the GSR outreach and engagement strategies.  \nMaintaining the engagement of both new and existing respondents remains an \nongoing challenge for the GSR, making outreach and engagement particularly \nchallenging. \n \n \n1. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND \n \nThe Grain Stocks publication is composed of quarterly surveys that provide detailed \nestimates of grains, oilseeds, and pulse crops stored in any commercial facility off the farm. \nThe Grain Stocks publication includes information collected from two separate surveys: The \nGrain Stocks Report (GSR) and the Crops Acreage, Production, and Stocks (Crops APS) \nSurvey. The GSR is conducted quarterly with reference dates of March 1, June 1, September \n1, and December 1. The Crops APS Survey is conducted at the same time as the GSR and \ncollects information on on-farm grain stocks. The Crops APS Survey also collects acreage, \nyield, and production data for various crops each quarter. These surveys are conducted in \nevery state and measure stocks of barley, canola, corn, flaxseed, mustard seed, oats, rapeseed, \nsafflower, sorghum, soybeans, sunflowers, and wheat. Estimates for grains, oilseeds, and \npulse crops from the GSR are combined with on-farm stocks estimates from the Crops APS \nSurvey and published in the Grain Stocks publication.",

The sampling frame is \ngrouped into specialty and non-specialty operations and stratified using off farm grain \nstorage capacity as a measure of size. For more information on the methodology on surveys \nused in the Grain Stocks publication, please see: Grain Stocks Methodology and Quality \nMeasures.  \nIn 2020, a technical evaluation of the GSR revealed a diminished level of response through \nthe web in contrast to phone or mail. At the start of each quarterly survey, pre-survey letters \nare sent to respondents with instructions on how to complete the survey; however, the letter \ndoes not include the survey website. This disparity may be attributed to a low percentage of \nvisitors to the GSR webpage, indicating that respondents may not be utilizing available web \nresponse tools. The primary goal of the NASS survey webpages is to educate the public \nabout NASS survey programs. The intended audience for NASS survey webpages typically \nincludes: the media, those sampled to respond to the survey, stakeholders, trade partners, and \nother interested parties. All NASS survey webpages provide a link and information on how \nto respond to the survey via the web using a respondent portal. The analytics of the GSR \nwebpage also showed visitors spent less time on the GSR survey webpage as opposed to \nother similar survey webpages with a lower percentage of visitors. In response to these \nchallenges, the GSR Outreach Team was formed to explore improved strategies for outreach, \nengagement, and delivering pertinent survey information to respondents regarding the GSR. \nA pilot study was conducted to describe and assess new outreach, communication, and \nengagement activities exclusively implemented in Illinois and Missouri within the Heartland \nRegion during the December 2022 and March 2023 quarterly GSR. At the time of this study, \nNASS operated twelve regional field offices nationwide (Appendix A), each tasked with \noverseeing implementation of the GSR. The study entails an exploration of the potential \napplications, benefits, and limitations associated with the deployment of these outreach and \nengagement activities. The goal of this research was to contribute a preliminary \nunderstanding of evaluating outreach and engagement that can be applicable to the GSR at a \nnational level. Additionally, it aims to assist in designing an outreach program and activities \nthat enhance awareness, such as the utilization of NASS data tools on the NASS website, \nincreased visitation to NASS survey webpages, increased use of the eAuthorization webpage, \nand the eventual creation of an evaluation tool to measure the success of new outreach and \nengagement activities.  \nThis report is organized into 5 sections: 1) Introduction and Background; 2) Methods - \nCurrent outreach activities and new outreach activities; 3) Results; 4) Conclusions and \nRecommendations; and 5) Limitations of the evaluation of outreach and engagement \nactivities.",

The Outreach Sub-team met with staff \nfrom the Census Bureau and the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) to discuss the use of \nQuick Response (QR) codes, infographics, and other common outreach and engagement \nactivities. The Census Bureau and the BEA shared an overview of the outreach and \nengagement methods they presently employ to enhance participation. The conversation \ndelved into the utilization of QR codes and their application in engagement activities, as well \nas the strategies for obtaining metrics for various initiatives.  \n \n1.2 Overview of Public Outreach Programs and Outreach Activities  \nEngagement with the farming population - already a challenging demographic to reach - \nbecomes even more complex when disseminating information to businesses encompassing \noff-farm grain storage, including elevators, merchant mills, etc., falling under the GSR \n(Freimuth et al 1990). By integrating strategies that foster participation within the off-farm \ngrain storage community and soliciting their input in decision-making regarding preferred \ncommunication methods, we can bolster our ability to establish connections and strengthen \nour partnership with the GSR program (Wiatrowski, 2008; Nguyen et al 2019; Freimuth et al \n1990). Four outreach and engagement methods and strategies were identified as necessary for \naddressing the primary research objectives while also establishing the initial framework for a \ncustomizable outreach and assessment plan. These are public outreach, outreach activities, \nand community engagement.  \nPublic outreach is a general term used to describe a variety of activities by a program to \npromote public awareness and understanding of a program (De Weger, E., Van Vooren, N., \nLuijkx, K.G. et al. 2018; Harrison et al 2009). Throughout this report, the term “outreach \nprogram(s)” is used to describe a specific type of public outreach. An outreach program \ngenerally targets participants or potential participants of a program that requires outreach \nactivities to promote engagement and participation in the program’s services. Generally, \noutreach programs are detailed documents that contain the goals of the outreach, the intended \naudience (who will receive the information and who matters to the research), and a detailed \ncollaboration plan with current and/or future partners (Cruickshank & Nowak, 2001; Levine-\nClark & Carter, 2013; McCown et 2011; Sapienza et al 2007). Once an outreach plan is \ncreated, evaluations on outreach activities should occur regularly to ensure goals are being \nmet and change activities that are producing poor results.\n \nOutreach activities are embedded in the outreach program and occur throughout the year to \npromote and provide access to the program’s services (Riesch et al. 2013). Outreach \nactivities are typically one-way communications designed to increase awareness and \neducation about the program. Activities will often consist of newsletters, social media posts, \nand other marketing tactics that allow the recipient to passively receive the information. \nThese activities are used to identify existing problems or challenges within the program and",

    "page_content": "8 \n \nto increase services participation and engagement (McCown et al 2011; Riesch et al. 2013; \nSapienza et al 2007). Outreach activities are generally short-term as they are meant to be \nbroad promotion of the program.  \nCommunity Engagement is a type of outreach activity; however, it is a more active method of \nimplementing change (De Weger, E., Van Vooren, N., Luijkx, K.G. et al. 2018; McCown et \nal 2011). Engagement is based on creating and sustaining relationships that are built and \nmaintained over time. Community engagement is a two-way communication or activity \nwhere the recipient provides inputs and becomes a part of the program process. Activities \nconsist of forums, web-based feedback, community-based committees, and interactive web \nprograms where the user can actively participate in the process of the program (McCown et \nal 2011; Bureau of Economic Analysis 2022). Community engagement activities are meant \nto be long-term activities that are relationship building and beneficial to the community.  \n \n2. METHODS \n2.1 Pilot Study Target Population - Heartland Region GSR Respondents  \n \nIn the planning phase of the pilot study, a comprehensive review was conducted for each \nNASS-assigned region to assess the potential engagement of outreach target activities during \nthe study. Illinois and Missouri, the two states in the Heartland Region, were selected to \nparticipate in the study. States in the Heartland Region were selected for several reasons. \nFirst, the distribution of grain elevators and the percentage of corn, soybeans, and wheat \ngrowers are more evenly spread compared to other regions. Second, the region has single \nelevators that typically report through hard copy mail returns, while multi-unit operations \nfacilities are reporting both through mail and via the internet.  \n \n2.2 Outreach Activities for the GSR  \n \nCurrently NASS employs outreach (marketing) initiatives to encourage response to survey \nprograms. Public outreach efforts for the GSR prior to the experiment included a public \nwebpage with information about the GSR, pre-survey letter, some social media postings \nabout the GSR, tradeshow participation, field outreach efforts by state statisticians and \nregional staff, and partner outreach (newsletter, email, calls, etc.). The public webpage for \nGSR provides information on the surveys in the Grain Stocks Report and links to access the \nquarterly reports from data acquired during each GSR survey cycle.  \n \nThe pre-survey letter for GSR was sent to respondents to remind them of the reasons why \ncompleting the GSR is important and the different ways to complete the survey. In addition, \nseveral social media posts were made to X (formerly Twitter) to promote and encourage \nrespondents to complete the GSR survey. For the December 2022 data collection, the X \nsocial media posts were made on 12/13/2022 (Figure 1) and 12/16/2022 (Figure 2). Images",

The objective of outreach and engagement activities \nfor this study was to explain the benefits of responding to the GSR request, introduce new \nweb tools, and create new levels of engagement with GSR respondents. For the purposes of \nthis research, each activity was evaluated to assess its impact on GSR respondents against its \nintended objective. \nTo inform an outreach program for potential respondents of the GSR survey, we conducted \nthree new outreach and engagement activities: 1) rack cards to encourage visiting the GSR \nwebpage or signing up for eAuthorization account with the option of using the URL or QR \ncodes for easy access; 2) a redesign of the GSR webpage, and 3) a feedback survey to \nencourage visitors to provide feedback on data and information they would like to see on the \nwebpage. The rack cards are an engagement/outreach activity, QR codes are engagement \nactivity, website redesign and feedback survey are also engagement activities.

The Outreach Team and \nNASS’s Public Affairs Office (PAO) collaboratively opted to design two racks cards: one \nfocusing on a GSR web push campaign and another promoting creating eAuthentication \nlogin and its benefits. The GSR web campaign card provided information on the latest \nfeatures of the GSR webpage, such as data visualizations, a crop progress map, and grain \nstocks videos. The second rack card aimed to educate respondents about the advantages of \ncreating an eAuthentication account. An eAuthentication (eAuth) is the system used by \nUSDA agencies such as NASS for customers to obtain accounts that will provide them \naccess to USDA/NASS web applications and services, including the NASS respondent \nportal. The benefits of using eAuth include completing surveys without a survey code, access \nto multiple USDA web applications, and the ability to view prior completed surveys.  \n \nThe rack cards served a dual purpose as the Outreach Team aimed to assess whether sending \nthem to respondents would either increase engagement with the GSR survey and/or provide \nan alternative to survey responses (web response), which might be a more convenient option \nfor businesses.  \n \nOnce a draft of the rack card was prepared by PAO, it was shared with the Outreach Team \nfor their initial review. During the weekly team meetings, the initial draft was reviewed \nthoroughly, and feedback was provided. After finalizing the rack cards, they were sent out \nalong with the pre-survey letter and questionnaire during the December 2022 and March \n2023 quarterly surveys.

RESULTS \n3.1 Response Rates \n3.1.1 Overall Response Rates for the Heartland Region  \nOne of the main goals of engaging in outreach is to increase the visibility of the survey and \nencourage survey responses. To help examine the efficacy of outreach efforts, the response \nrates for the GSR were examined. The survey response rates during the December 2022 and \nMarch 2023 data collections for the Heartland Region were compared to the previous year’s \ndata collections. The prior years response rates were used as a comparison group as no \nadditional outreach efforts or mailings were conducted in any of the states in the region \nduring that time. Please note that these comparisons have not been evaluated for statistical \nsignificance. For the December 2022 data collection in the Heartland Region, the 2021 \nresponse rate was 79.8% and the 2022 response rate was 80.4%. The change in response rate \nfor the December data collection was an increase of +0.7% (December 2022 GSR Board \nReport). For the March 2023 data collection, the 2022 response rate was 78.8% and the 2023 \nresponse rate was 79.1%, an increase of +0.3% (March 2023 GSR Board Report).   \nBoth data collection periods saw an increase in responses from the previous year’s data \ncollection when the outreach strategies were being conducted, which included the marketing \ninsert mailing.

With these changes, a higher \nincrease in feedback or recommendation for changes that would benefit the visitor to the site \nmay be observed. \n \n4. CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS \n \nImproving efficacy of engaging respondents can be achieved by creating a tailored outreach \nprogram with activities specifically designed for each survey. This approach facilitates \nmeaningful conversations with operations, fosters partnerships, collects valuable input for \nimproving the GSR survey webpage, and informs respondents about new tools available for \nsurvey completion. When campaign cards were changed to include more detailed instructions, \nan increase in QR code scans did occur; however, we could not find clear relationships between \nthe rack cards, QR codes, and URLs linking to the GSR webpage. Recipients of the rack cards \nmay have typed in the URL or used a saved link to access the webpage. The increase in \nwebpage visits does show the respondents are interested in engaging with the GSR webpage , \nbut may require more engaging features on the webpage. If the GSR survey continued mailing \ncampaigns in addition to including these materials for in- person outreach events, we should \nsee further involvement from operators and receive information on what tools and information \nwill be beneficial to them. Throughout the study , the O utreach Team assumed repeated \nexposure to new products would encourage repeat ed visits to the GS R webpage or further \nexploration of eAuth benefits, etc . (Hekkert et al. 2013) . What we discovered was a repeated \nexposure to new outreach products did not increase visibility to the GSR survey webpage or \nQR code scans.  \n \nThe summary statistics of both December 2022 and March 2023 treatment groups did not \nappear to reveal any notable differences. It is important to note that the research’s primary \nobjective was not to look for statistically significant differences but to explore the feasibility \nof expanding outreach efforts. The research aimed to utilize a small sample size for the \ndevelopment of outreach activities and the creation of an evaluation assessment tool. This \nmethod was designed to ultimately enhance the success of survey programs by providing \nrespondents with simplified response methods and relevant survey information. Looking at \nthe descriptive statistics between December 2021 and December 2022 as well as March 2022 \nand March 2023, a slight decrease in the response rate was observed when comparing the \nDecember 2022 and March 2023 experiment groups, but this was not tested for statistical \nsignificance.",

It reinforces the notion that repeated \nexposure to new outreach materials with no immediate changes did not enhance visibility for \neither the GSR survey webpage or QR code scans. The limitations of the research hindered a \nmore comprehensive explanation of this phenomenon and are addressed in Section 5.  \nTo help improve the respondent experience and gain more information about whether current \npromotion and public awareness efforts are being successful, we recommend a Response \nAnalysis Survey (RAS) and a Nonresponse Analysis Survey (NRAS) with respondents and \nnonrespondents, respectively, as follow-up surveys to a future GSR survey. The cost \nassociated with this data collection effort would be relatively small, as it would be conducted \nthrough an online survey platform, Qualtrics.  \nNASS has previously conducted nonresponse analyses to gain a better understanding of \nsurvey nonresponse and aid in determining what areas in the data collection process need \nimprovement (including promotion and/or public awareness). These analyses studied the \nFarm Costs and Returns Survey (FCRS), a predecessor to Agricultural Resource \nManagement Survey (ARMS) with many overlapping topic areas (O’Connor, 1991; \nO’Connor, 1992), and ARMS 3 (Gerling et al., 2008). More recently, response and non-\nresponse analysis was conducted on ARMS 2, focusing on the experiences of not just non-\nresponders but on why respondents chose to answer a survey (Herrell and Van Horn, 2023). \nThe benefit of conducting both response and non-response analysis in surveys is that it \nallows the motivating factors behind operator behaviors, including perceptions on the \nusefulness of the data, marketing materials, and influences on future survey response \nbehaviors, to be identified.  \nBased on these findings, the following changes are recommended:  \nShort Term Recommendations  \n1. Expand testing of outreach informational materials to the GSR in FY24.  \n \na. Establish a uniform format for future survey informational materials incorporating \nQR codes and/or rack cards.  \n \nb. Continue assessing the efficacy of these informational materials.  \n \nc. Establish effective partnerships that have connections and credibility with elevators \nand operators surveyed in the GSR.",

LIMITATIONS OF THE EVALUATION OF OUTREACH AND ENGAGEMENT \nACTIVITIES  \n \nWhile the research fulfilled the requirements for a qualitative pilot study, it fell short of \nmeeting the researchers’ expectations on various fronts. The limited sample size in this initial \nendeavor restricted insights into respondent and stakeholder behaviors when exposed to new \nengagement and outreach materials. Participants in the sample received identical rack cards \nfor both the December 2022 and March 2023 experiments. It is crucial to emphasize that with \nthe research design and the small sample size, this pilot did not allow for statistical testing, \nbut if an experiment is designed for the entire GSR sample on a national level such testing \ncould be conducted.  \nChallenges arose in collecting analytics and assessing new engagement activities on the \nNASS and eAuthentication webpages.",

    "page_content": "34 \n \n \nIntegration issues persisted, particularly with the eAuthentication website, which is managed \nby the USDA rather than NASS. Consequently, tracking changes in site visitors or eAuth \nsignups related to the QR code on the eAuthentication rack card proved unfeasible. \nAdditionally, the research was unable to isolate NASS employees who used the NASS survey \nwebpages during the December and March evaluations. The analytics programs used could \nnot separate NASS employee's webpage visits who may be located outside of Washington, \nD.C headquarters from a non-employee visitor.  \nFurthermore, the analytics from Siteimprove required setting up a Siteimprove campaign for \neach website URL in order to capture detailed information. This means that we did not \ncapture users and behaviors for any variations of the GSR webpage address that may have \nbeen used. Future research should better account for additional variations on the GSR \nwebpage address to get a more complete understanding of user's interactions with the site. \nFor example, ideally, we would want to capture variations such as: \nhttps://www.nass.usda.gov/Surveys/Guide_to_NASS_Surveys/Off-\nFarm_Grain_Stocks/index.php as well as   \nhttps://www.nass.usda.gov/Surveys/Guide_to_NASS_Surveys/Off-Farm_Grain_Stocks/.    \nAnother compromise in the research involved conducting a pilot study to reduce costs, with \nthe intent to implement a fully developed outreach and impact evaluation tool for the GSR \nthe following year. Since the research will not be implemented on a national level for the \nGSR, the development of a prospective impact evaluation template, applicable universally \nacross all NASS surveys, could not be fully conceptualized. Ultimately, the research can only \nyield results specific to the new engagement activities and lacks the capacity for a universal \napplication of impact evaluations to NASS survey outreach endeavors.  \nThe small sample size of this initial effort gave the research a limited but useful insight into \nrespondent and stakeholders behaviors when provided new engagement and outreach \nmaterials. Future studies should include a more robust experimental design expanded beyond \ntwo states to be able to produce more generalizable results. The respondents included in the \nsample for this research received the same rack cards for both the December 2022 and March \n2023 quarterly survey.  \nAttempts were made to gather user feedback on the GSR webpage by creating a feedback \nform. A limitation of this feedback form was that it was static, and users had to click an \nadditional button to be prompted to provide feedback. This is different than how most of the \nfeedback is gathered across the NASS website. Future research should look at alternative \nways to gather user feedback, especially given only one feedback response was received. \nFuture research could look to have better integration with existing feedback surveys that are \ncurrently being conducted on the NASS website.  \nDespite these limitations, the research did reflect engaging the GSR respondent community \nwas effective, even on a small scale. Ongoing research at the national level for the GSR may \nprovide a better understanding of how to target respondents for outreach programs that",

As the world's \nlargest milk producer, the sector ensures food \nsecurity, generates employment and supports rural \ndevelopment by providing income and insurance \nagainst crop failures. It empowers women, boosts \nforeign exchange through exports, and fosters \nsustainability through integrated farming. \nAdditionally, it supports diverse rural enterprises, \nenhancing livelihoods and socio-economic stability \nacross India.\n1.2  Livestock production and agriculture share \na symbiotic relationship, evolving together as key \ncomponents of sustainable food systems. Beyond \ntheir traditional roles, the livestock sector now \nemerges as a driver of innovation and resilience in \nrural economies. By integrating modern practices \nlike climate-smart livestock farming, renewable \nenergy generation through biogas, and \nregenerative grazing systems, it contributes to \nenvironmental sustainability. Moreover, livestock \nserves as a platform for entrepreneurship, \nparticularly for women and marginalized groups, \nfostering financial inclusion and equitable growth. \nCHAPTER- 1OVERVIEW OF \nACHIEVEMENTS\n1.3  Impact of livestock manure on soil health, \nhighlighting its benefits for soil chemical, physical, \nand biological properties. Manure enhances soil \nfertility by improving nutrient availability, organic \nmatter content, and cation exchange capacity while \nreducing bulk density and increasing porosity. It \npositively influences soil water retention, \ninfiltration, and erosion resistance. Additionally, \nmanure supports microbial diversity and activity, \ncrucial for nutrient cycling and soil productivity. \nHowever, the effects depend on manure type, \napplication rate, and environmental conditions. \nWhile manure provides a sustainable alternative to \nsynthetic fertilizers, challenges like nutrient runoff \nand variability in outcomes underscore the need for \nproper management practices.\n1.4  According to Periodic Labour Force Survey \n(PLFS) conducted during July, 2022- June, 2023 and \nJuly, 2023- June, 2024, estimated percentage of \nworkers in usual status (ps+ss) engaged in industry \ngroup 014 (Animal production) and Industry \nGroup 015 (Mixed farming) of National Industry \nClassification (NIC-2008) is given in table below:- \nTable 1: Percentage of usually working persons (ps+ss) engaged in Industry Group 014 and \n015 of NIC-2008 during PLFS 2022-23 & 2023-24\nIndustry group  (3-digit code) \nas per NIC- 2008) \nDescription of \nIndustry  Group\n \npercentage of usually \n working persons (ps+ss)\n 2022-23 \npercentage of usually \nworking  persons (ps+ss)\n 2023-24 \n014 Animal production 6.45 6.34 \n015 Mixed farming 3.63 4.34 \nSource: Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) Report, 2022-23 & 2023-24, MoSPI\nThe data shows a slight decline in the workforce for \nanimal production (6.45% to 6.34%) and a notable \nincrease in mixed farming (3.63% to 4.34%) from \n2022-23 to 2023-24.

The 303.76 million bovines (including \ncattle, buffalo, mithun, and yak) signify the \nbackbone of dairy production and draught power \nin agriculture. Sheep (74.26 million) and goats \n(148.88 million) contribute to meat, milk, and wool \nproduction, essential for arid and semi-arid \nregions, while pigs (9.06 million) cater to niche \nmarkets in northeastern and tribal areas. The \ndominant poultry population (851.81 million) \nunderscores its critical role in providing affordable \nprotein through eggs and meat.\nAnalyzing the data reveals significant diversity in \nspecies distribution, each adapted to regional \nclimatic and cultural needs, supporting both \nsubsistence and commercial farming.

Earlier schemes of \nGovernment of India have emphasis on \ncrossbreeding for enhancing milk production in the \ncountry.  Scheme is important for upliftment of \nrural poor as more than 80% low producing \nindigenous animals are with small and marginal \nfarmers and landless labours. \nThe scheme has been playing important role in \nenhancing milk production and productivity of \nbovines to meet growing demand of milk and \nmaking dairying more remunerative to the rural \nfarmers of the country. The scheme has been \nleading to multiplication of elite animals of \nindigenous breeds and increased availability of \nindigenous stock. \nDue to implementation of scheme and other \nmeasures taken by Government of India, the \nannual growth rate of milk production in the \ncountry during 2014-15 to 2023-24 is 5.69% over the \npast 10 years whereas, World milk production is \ngrowing at 2% per annum. Productivity of all \ncategory of animals including descript non-\ndescript cattle, buffaloes and crossbred cattle has \nincreased by 25.74 % from 1647 kg per animal per \nyear during 2014-15 to 2071 kg per animal per year \nin 2023-24 which is highest productivity growth \nrate in the World. Similarly productivity of \nbuffaloes has increased from 1792 kg per animal per \nyear in 2013-14 to 2161 kg per animal per year in \n2023-24. Number of animals in milk has increased \nfrom 84.08 million in 2013-14 to 111.76 million in \n2023-24 that is by 32.93%. Indigenous cattle \n(descript and non descript cattle) has increased by \n25% during the same period. Milk production from \nindigenous cattle has increased from 28.13 million \ntonnes in 2013-14 to 49.91 million tonnes in 2023-24 \nthat is by 77.42%. The per capita availability of milk \nis 471 grams per day in 2023-24 as against the World \naverage of 394 grams per day. Per capita availability \nhas increased from 319 grams per person per day in \n2014-15 to 471 grams per person per day in 2023-24 \nshowing a growth of 47.64%. \nThe graphs below show the increase in milk \nproduction in India over the years from 84 MMT in \n2001-02 to 239.30 MMT in 2023-24. Graph also \nshows the increase in productivity of bovines \n(Kg/year) from 2014 to 2022. India has shown a \n27.39 percent increase in the same, which is the \nhighest, followed by China, Germany, and \nDenmark. It is also interesting to note that \npercentage increase in India exceeds the World \naverage which stands at 13.97 percent.\n                  Milk Production in MMT over the years                  Enhancement in productivity Comparison\nAnnual Report 2024-25 31",

Central Cattle \nBreeding Farms were introduced by Govt. of India \nin various agro climatic zones of the country \nbetween 1968 to 1976 under various five-year plans. \nTheir main aim is to make available germplasm \nwith high genetic potential of important \nindigenous and exotic cattle breeds (Holstein \nFriesian and Jersey) within the country so as to \nserve as a backbone of the dairy industry. These \nfarms have played crucial role in supply of \nbreeding inputs in the form of disease free HGM \nbulls of indigenous and exotic breeds and frozen \nsemen doses. \n3.2.2.2 There are seven Central Cattle Breeding \nFarms (CCBFs) located at Alamadhi (Tamil Nadu), \nAndeshnagar (UP), Chiplima&Sunabeda (Odisha), \nDhamrod (Gujarat), Hessarghatta (Karnataka) and \nSuratgarh (Rajasthan).  These CCBFs are engaged \nin scientific breeding of cattle and buffaloes with \nthe aim of production of high pedigreed bulls for \ngenetic upgradation programmes. Besides, these \nfarms are also providing awareness training to the \nfarmers and breeders. \nAs per decision taken by the Ministry with effect \nfrom 01.04.2023 technical management of three \nfarms i.e. CCBF-Alamadhi, CCBF-Andeshnagar& \nCCBF-Dhamrod have been transferred to National \nDairy Development Board(NDDB) to establish \nDairy Innovation Centre's as Centre of Excellence \nby creating additional infrastructure and \nmodernization of farms and perform all activities as \nper guidelines of Rashtriya Gokul Mission (RGM).\n3.2.2.3 These farms are producing high \npedigreed bull calves of indigenous, exotic breeds \nAnnual Report 2024-25 55",

As a result of prudent policy \ninterventions, India ranks first among the world's \nmilk producing nations, achieving an annual \nproduction of 239.30 million tonnes during the year \n2023-24 as compared to 230.58 million tonnes \nduring 2022-23 recording a growth rate of 3.78%. \nDairying has become an important secondary \nsource of income for millions of rural families and \nhas assumed the most important role in providing \nemployment and income generating opportunities \nparticularly for women and marginal farmers. The \nper capita availability of milk has reached a level of \n471 grams per day during the year 2023-24 which is \nmore than the world average of around 329 grams \nper day in 2023 (estimates) (Food Outlook Nov'24). \nMost of the milk in the country is produced by \nsmall, marginal farmers and landless labourers.\n4.1.1  Economic Significance of Dairying\nLivestock sub-sector plays a vital role in the Indian \neconomy and also in the socio-economic \ndevelopment of millions of rural households. \nLivestock is a principal source of draught power in \nrural areas and provides milk, meat, eggs, wool, \nhides & skins, manure and fuel. it is accounted for \nabout 5.50% of total GVA of India (at current prices) \nand 30.23% of the GVA of agriculture & allied \nsector. The contribution of agriculture & allied \nsector to the national GVA has been falling from a \nlevel of 25.17% in 1999-20 to 18.19% in 2022-23 (at \ncurrent price). However, the contribution of \nlivestock sector to the total GVA has increased from \n4.7% to 5.5% during the same period (at current \nprice).\n4.1.2  Share of milk production and supply\nIn India, about 37% of the milk produced is either \nconsumed at the producer level or sold to non-\nproducers in the rural area, the balance 63% of the \nmilk is available for sale to organized and \nunorganized players. Organized sector comprises \nof government, producers' owned institutions \n(milk cooperatives & milk producer organization) \nand private players which provides fair and \ntransparent system of milk collection round the \nyear at the village level. The total size of dairy \nmarket was about Rs.18.98 lakh crore in 2024. and is \nexpected to reach a market size of about Rs. 57.00 \nlakh crore by 2033 as per IMARC 2025 report.\n4.1.3 Demand\nThe drivers of demand for milk in India are - \npopulation growth, urbanization and increasing \nper capita income. The consumption of milk has \nAnnual Report 2024-25 71\nAs per the FAO Dairy Market Review (2024) the \nworld milk production will grow from 966.6 \nmillion tonnes in 2023 (estimates) to 981.1 million \ntonnes in 2024 (Nov.) which translated to a growth \nof 1.5 %. Further as per the Basic Animal \nHusbandry Statistics-2024 milk production of India \nis estimated to reach 254.19 million tonnes in 2024-\n25 registering a growth of 6.22% (estimated) over \nthe last year beating the world average growth rate.",

Milk with its \nvaried benefits is a primary source of protein for the \nlargely vegetarian population of the country. \nFurther, factors such as increased consumer interest \nin high protein diets and increasing awareness & \navailability of dairy products through channels \nsuch as organized retail chain are also driving this \ngrowth. \nThe milk consuming population has been \nconsistently rising in the country both in rural and \nurban areas. According to Household Consumer \nExpenditure Survey (HCES, 2022-23) of NSSO, \nabout 93% and 95% of rural and urban population \nrespectively reported consumption of milk and \nmilk products in the country. The growth in above \nfactors indicates that the demand for milk & milk \nproducts will rise consistently in future.\n4.1.4 Organised Sector\n4.1.4.1 Cooperative Sector \nThree tier structure \nVillage Cooperative Society: The main pattern \nfollowed by Village Cooperative Societies in India \nis an Anand model village dairy cooperative society \n(DCS) of milk producers. Any producer can become \na DCS member by buying a share and committing \nto sell milk only to the society. Each DCS has a milk \ncollection centre where members take milk every \nday. Each member's milk is tested for quality with \npayments based on the percentage of fat and Solids-\nNot Fat (SNF). At the end of each year, a portion of \nthe DCS profits is used to pay each member a \npatronage bonus based on the quantity of milk \npoured.\nThe District Union: A District Cooperative Milk \nProducers' Union is owned by dairy cooperative \nsocieties. The Union buys all the societies' milk, \nthen processes and markets fluid milk and \nproducts. Most Unions also provide a range of \ninputs and services to DCSs and their members: \nfeed, veterinary care, artificial insemination to \nsustain the growth of milk production and the \ncooperatives' business. Union staff train and \nprovide consulting services to support DCS leaders \nand staff.\nThe State Federation: The cooperative milk \nproducers' unions in a state form, a State \nFederation, which is responsible for marketing the \nfluid milk and products of member unions. Some \nfederations also manufacture feed and support \nother union activities.\n4.1.4.2  Current status: In the cooperative sector, \nthere are 22 Milk Federations, 241 district \ncooperative milk unions, 28 marketing dairies, 25 \nMilk Producer Organizations covering about 2.35 \nlakh villages and 1.72 Crore dairy farmers as \nmembers. \n4.1.4.3 Milk Producer Organizations\nNDDB Dairy Services (NDDB-DS), the not-for-\nprofit wholly owned subsidiary of NDDB had \nfacilitated incorporation and operationalization of \nMilk Producer Organizations (MPOs). NDDB-DS \nhas successfully set up 22 MPOs. Among the 22 \nMPOs six were supported under the National Dairy \nPlan (Phase I). Fifteen of these 22 MPOs have an all-\nwomen membership and all the producer directors \non their respective boards are women. Together, \nthese MPOs have around 10.05 lakh milk producers \nspread over about 24,116 villages. 73.54 per cent of \nthese producers are women and 65 per cent are \nsmall holder milk producers. The members of these \norganisations raised around Rs.233 crore towards \nshare capital.

The \nQuarantine Services are necessary to keep the \ncountry free from exotic diseases.\nThere are many infectious diseases of livestock \nwhich are prevalent in other countries but India is \nfree from them. It is therefore necessary that such \nexotic diseases do not gain entry into our country \nthrough movement of livestock and livestock \nproducts from abroad.

From \nimproving animal health and disease control to \nenhancing veterinary services, resource allocation, \nfeed and fodder production, and boosting \nlivestock-based industries, validated statistics are \nindispensable. Leveraging advanced technologies \nand inclusive methodologies, the Livestock Census \n(LC) and Integrated Sample Survey (ISS) emerge as \nthe twin pillars for generating precise animal \nhusbandry data, paving the way for sustainable \ngrowth and rural empowerment.\n7.1 Integrated Sample Survey (ISS)\nThe Department of Animal Husbandry and \nDairying (DAHD) plays a pivotal role in estimating \nthe annual production of four Major Livestock \nProducts (MLP)—Milk, Eggs, Meat, and \nWool—through the Integrated Sample Survey \n(ISS). This nationwide scheme ensures the timely \ngeneration of MLP estimates, serving as an \nimportant tool for policy formulation and strategic \nplanning.\nImplemented across all States and Union \nTerritories (UTs), the scheme benefits from Central \nAssistance: 50% for States, 90% for Northeastern \nStates, and 100% for UTs to cover salaries of entitled \nAnnual Report 2024-25 131\npersonnel.

    "page_content": "Agriculture and Allied Sectors\nCrop wise Analysis\nRice\nRice is the most important food crop grown in Kerala. It occupies 7.46 percent of the total cropped area of the state. However, the area under rice has been falling at an alarming rate ever since the 1980s. From 8.82 lakh hectare in 1974-75, the paddy area has come down to 1.96 lakh hectare in 2015-16. The production has also concomitantly declined from 13.76 lakh MT in 1972-73 (peak of production) to 5.49 lakh MT in 2015-16 (Appendix 2.4). Moreover, the productivity of the crop is very low in the State (2790 kg/ha), though it is higher than the national average (2424 kg/ha). There has only been a marginal increase in the productivity of rice in the past four decades. China, which is the major producer of rice in the world, reports a productivity (6744 kg/ha) more than three times the productivity of rice in Kerala. The productivity of rice in Egypt is the highest in the world (9088 kg/ha), which is nearly four-fold of our productivity. Punjab is the state with the highest yield in the country (3952 kg/ha). In the recent months, the State government has taken a number of steps for the promotion of paddy cultivation.\n\nMajor initiatives for the promotion of rice in 2016-17 \n\nPromotion of upland rice cultivation in 2520 ha\nAmendment in Paddy land/Wetland Conservation Act\nCultivation in fallow lands\nSpecial projects in Aranmula Punja\n Declaring Chingam 1st of 2016 to Chingam 1st of 2017 as the rice year in which 100 activities are planned\nEnhancement of procurement price of paddy from 21.50/Kg to 22.50/Kg\n\n Source: Agriculture Department\nThere are three main rice growing seasons in the state: (a) Virippu season/Autumn season/First crop season, which starts in April-May and extends up to September-October; (b) Mundakan season/Winter season/Second crop season, which starts in September-October and extends up to December-January; and (c) Puncha season/Summer season/Third crop season, which starts in December-January and extends up to March-April. In Kerala, winter crop (mundakan) has been greater than the other two crops (summer and autumn) both in terms of area as well as production. However, in 2015-16, all the three seasons showed a declining trend resulting in an overall reduction in production(Appendix 2.5). \nPalakkad, Alappuzha, Thrissur and Kottayam account for about 81.2 percent of the total production of rice in the state, their individual shares being 41 percent, 16 percent, 14 percent and 9 percent respectively. In 2015-16, Alappuzha and Palakkad recorded a decline in production, while Thrissur and Kottayam recorded a slight increase in production. District-wise area under rice cultivation shows that area under rice fell for all the districts of the State between 1996-97 and 2012-13. However, the decline was sharpest for Ernakulam (93 per cent) followed by Kollam (92 per cent), Thiruvananthapuram (86 per cent) and Malappuram (78 per cent). On the positive side, in Kottayam and Alappuzha, the major rice growing districts, the decline was much less pronounced (13 and 12 per cent respectively). In 2015-16, Palakkad, Alappuzha and Wayanad, showed a decline in area as well as production of rice in the State (Details as given in Appendix 2.6 and Appendix 2.7 and Figure 2.4).\r\n \nFigure 2.4\r\n              Percentage change in area and production of rice in major districts \r\n              of Kerala during 2015-16 over 2014-15, in per cent",

    "page_content": "Source: Directorate of Economics and Statistics, Govt. of Kerala\nArea cultivated with paddy has increasingly been converted into cultivation with other crops as well as for non-agricultural purposes. This is mainly due to the low relative profitability in paddy cultivation, which in turn is a result of increasing costs due to rising wages and relative price changes in favour of competing crops. In spite of focused interventions through the State plan and programmes like Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY), enhancement of per hectare assistance from 1500 to 4500 in the 12th plan period and the introduction of procurement in all districts, rice production has not responded positively. More proactive steps under the leadership of the Department of Agriculture and local bodies are required to revitalise rice production in the State.\nCoconut\nIn terms of area under cultivation, coconut is the most important crop in the state with over 7.9 lakh hectare under cultivation. It accounts for the largest share in the Gross Cropped Area (GCA) followed by rubber and paddy. Kerala has the largest area under the crop in the country, but in terms of production it comes third. This indicates the low productivity of the crop in the state with just 7535 nuts per hectare compared to Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh where the productivity is 14,873 nuts per hectare and 13,808 nuts per hectare respectively in 2014-15. Also, Kerala’s share in area and production of coconut in the country has declined over time. While Kerala accounted for 69.58 per cent of the area and 69.52 per cent of the production in the country in 1960-61, the corresponding shares declined to 40.2 per cent and 42.12 per cent respectively in 2011-12. However, the area and production of coconut in the state has been increasing. From 29.88 per cent of the Net Sown Area in 1980-81, the share of area cultivated with coconut increased to 41.96 per cent in 2000-01; in 2011-12, the corresponding share stood at 40.24 per cent. The production also increased during this period. From 3220 million nuts in 1960-61, the production increased to 5536 million nuts in 2000-01. After that the production plateaued and was more or less stagnant in the next decade. Thus, the increase in output was more on account of increase in acreage as the productivity of the crop is very low in the state. Between 2014-15 and 2015-16, there was a marginal decline in the production of coconut from 5947 million nuts to 5873 million nuts. Area, production and productivity of coconut in Kerala are given in Appendix 2.8\nThe main reason for the falling productivity of coconut is the prevalence of the root wilt disease, poor crop management and the existence of senile and unproductive palms. Hence, massive replanting of palms affected by root wilt with elite palms and elimination of senile palms, setting up of nurseries for production of quality seedlings and their subsequent distribution is essential for increasing productivity. Restructuring of the cluster development programme is also essential for more effectiveness. The attempt made by the Department of Agriculture and Cooperation to restructure two coconut development programmes through convergence approach at the panchayat level, coupled with a price advantage, is expected to revive coconut production in the state. The isolated attempts at the production of dwarf coconut seedlings and hybrids need to be scaled up substantially with the support of research institutions. Entrepreneurial ventures for the production of value-added products like desiccated coconut, beverages, shell-based products, coconut cream, and neera have to be promoted with appropriate tie-ups with credit and marketing agencies. The coconut procurement system through Krishi Bhavans in association with Kerafed was introduced in 2012-13, which needs further streamlining. The initiative taken by the government in promoting neera and value addition are expected to revive coconut economy of the state.\nPepper\nIndia comes third in the production of pepper in the world after Vietnam and Indonesia. However, the production of pepper in the country has been stagnant at around 50,000 tonnes in the last few years and hence is fast losing its status as a leading producer and exporter of pepper. Grown mostly in the slopes of Western Ghats in Kerala, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu, the area under cultivation of pepper has come down drastically in the last decade, which has adversely affected production and export. In 2015-16, pepper production recorded a decline to 55,000 tonnes from 70,000 tonnes in 2014-15. However, Kerala, which accounts for 75 percent of the total production in the country, recorded a slight increase in pepper production from 40.6 thousand tonnes in 2014-15 to 42.1 thousand tonnes in 2015-16.",

    "page_content": "With regard to prices, there has been a rally in pepper prices since 2010. However, in 2015, the prices registered a decline to 630.31 per kg from 646.79 per kg in 2014. The price realization during 2016 (January-June) was 669.29 per kg compared to 619.76 per kg in June 2015, an increase of  49.53 per kg. \nPepper production in the State in recent years has been affected mainly by low productivity and various diseases. In order to revive spices development in the state, the Department of Agriculture had initiated comprehensive pepper development programmes in all districts in 2014-15. An integrated action plan was prepared for the revival of the crop, covering reorientation of planting material production, expansion of grafting wherever possible, area-wide disease management, liming and nutrients management and revival of pepper samities. The increase in production achieved during 2015-16 could be because of this concerted effort by the State Government.\nCashew\nIn 2015-16, India continued to be the largest producer of raw cashew nuts in the world. The other main producing countries were Vietnam, Brazil, Tanzania and Ivory Coast. The production of raw cashew nuts in India declined from 725 thousand MT in 2014-15 to 670 thousand MT in 2015-16. The area under cashew cultivation, however, recorded an increase from 1027 thousand hectares to 1034 thousand hectares.\nIn Kerala, in the last one decade, there has been a continuous and considerable decline in both area under cultivation as well as production of cashew. It is alarming to note that the production, which stood at 60 thousand MT in 2004-05, declined to 33.3 thousand MT in 2013-14 and to 24.73 thousand MT in 2015-16. The area under cultivation dwindled from 81,000 hectares to 49,000 hectares and to 43,000 hectares during the same period. The productivity of cashew, which was around 900 kg per hectare during the late eighties, also fell to 654 kg per hectare in 2014-15. Details are given in Appendix 2.9\nArea under and production of cashew have risen steadily in other producing states of the country. Even though Andhra Pradesh has the highest area under cultivation (18.3 per cent), Maharashtra is the leading producer with 32.9 percent share in production during 2013-14.\nPlantation crops\nPlantation crops are, in general, either export-oriented or import-substituting and therefore assume special significance from the national point of view. It is estimated that nearly 14 lakh families are dependent on the plantation sector for livelihood. Each of the four plantation crops of South India has its distinct characteristics and economic problems. Consequent to the removal of quantitative restrictions on imports, plantation crops are facing the threat of a surge in low quality imports.\nKerala has a substantial share in the area in India cultivated with the four plantation crops of rubber, tea, coffee and cardamom. These four crops together occupy 7.04 lakh ha, accounting for 26.88 percent of the gross cropped area in the state. During 2013-14, Kerala’s share in the national production was 72.02 per cent in rubber, 22 per cent in coffee and 6.3 percent in tea. Details are given in Appendix 2.10\nRubber",

    "page_content": "Rubber\nProduction of Natural Rubber (NR) in India declined by 12.9 per cent from 6.45 lakh tones in 2014-15 to 5.62 lakh tonnes in 2015-16. Even though tappable area under natural rubber was 5.59 lakh ha during 2015-16, only 3.91 lakh ha of area contributed to the NR production during the year. Consequently, the average yield, measured in terms of production per hectare of tapped area, declined to 1437 kg/ha in 2015-16 as compared to 1443 kg/ha the previous year. During 2016-17, the production is estimated to be 6.54 lakh tonnes of NR. Adverse weather, high wages, lack of skilled labourers and the grower’s reluctance in harvesting or maintaining trees in response to the low NR prices have affected the production of natural rubber (NR) in India in 2016. The consumption of NR in the country also came down by 2.6 percent to 10.2 lakh tonnes in 2014-15. This was due to a 2.5 percent decline in auto tyre manufacturing and a 2.7 percent fall in the general rubber goods production. The volume of exports came down to 865 tonnes in 2015-16 from 1002 tonnes in 2014-15. The Central Government continued to provide incentives for exporting quality–endorsed branded Indian Natural Rubber under a Market–linked Focus Product Scheme. The production scene was no different in Kerala also, as the total production dwindled from 5.07 lakh MT in 2014-15 to 4.38 lakh MT in 2015-16. \nWith regard to rubber prices, it has been volatile in both the national and international markets. NR prices after scaling to an all-time high during 2011 had fallen significantly, that too at an accelerating pace threatening the very existence of the rubber producers. Rubber prices , both in the domestic and international markets had been moving in tandem throughout the year. Domestic RRSS-4 and international RSS-3 prices increased from April 2015 to June 2015 and then started decreasing from July 2015 to February 2016 and started slow recovery during the end of the year. Main reasons for the fall in rubber prices were moderate economic growth in China, slow recovery in the US and Europe, enhanced stock in Thailand, increase in world stock of NR, relatively low oil prices and consequent low synthetic rubber prices. The domestic RSS-4 price at Kottayam market came down and averaged at 113.06 per kg during 2015-16 compared to 132.57 per kg during the previous year. Domestic RSS4 price peaked at 133 per kg on 17.06.2015 and international price of RSS-3 peaked at 122 per kg on 03.06.2015. Domestic RSS-4 prices was ruling above the international RSS-3 price throughout the year during 2015-16. Details are given in Appendix 2.11, Appendix 2.12 and Appendix 2.13\nThe declining rubber production in the year has affected India’s ranking internationally as it has been pushed to the fifth position with countries like Vietnam and China occupying the third and fourth position respectively. Thailand continues to be the top producer followed by Indonesia in the second spot in the global rubber scene. \nThe declining price of rubber is a cause of concern. A revival of rubber prices is expected based on the revision of import duty and other measures taken by Government of India. However, more proactive measures by the central government are essential to support the rubber growers of Kerala. The strengthening and reorientation of Price Stabilisation Fund is essential. The Government of Kerala has introduced a rubber production incentive scheme with a financial support of Rs 300 crores. However, to a large extent the price depends on global supply and demand of natural rubber and the price of synthetic rubber. \nCoffee",

    "page_content": "Coffee\nDomestic coffee production for the year 2015-16 was estimated at 348,000 tonnes, which represents an increase of 21,000 tonnes compared to previous year. Initially, the Coffee Board had projected 2015-16 crop production (Post Blossom estimate) at 355,000 tonnes, which was subsequently revised downwards by  7,000 tonnes. As per the revised figure, the Arabica production was estimated at 103.5 thousand tonnes (29.7 per cent) and Robusta at 244.5 thousand tonnes (70.3 per cent). However, as per FAO estimates, yield in India at 845.6 kg per hectare is much below that of Vietnam (2499.1 kg per hectare) and Brazil (1421.5 kg per hectare). A comparison of the productivity levels in 1971 vis-a-vis 2011 suggests that India (-1.8 per cent) and Indonesia (-0.1 per cent) are the only two countries that reported a decline in yield levels in the last 40 years. Lower productivity in India is due to limited mechanization, pest infestation, existence of old/senile plants and labour shortage. Thus, on the productivity side, much more is needed to be done and towards this concerted efforts are required both at the policy and farm level. The only way to address this issue is by providing positive research and development which can directly contribute in achieving higher yield.\nWith regard to Kerala, the production of coffee registered a slight increase from 67,700 MT in 2014-15 to 69,230 MT in 2015-16. The share of Kerala in total coffee production in the country is around 20 per cent during the year. Major variety grown in Kerala is Robusta with a share of 97.1 per cent in planted area. Productivity of the crop in terms of bearing area in Kerala is 808 kg/ha, which is lower than the national level of 852 kg/ha during 2011-12. Among the States, Kerala stands next to Karnataka which produces 70.4 percent of total Indian coffee production. \nTea\nAs one of the largest tea producing countries, India accounts for 24.8 percent of the total world production. The Tea Board had revised the production figures during 2011 by bringing within the net all segments of tea producers, both organized and unorganized, especially North India many of whom were not reporting their crop statistics earlier, which helped India in breaching the 1 billion mark. The domestic tea production during 2015 was 1191.1mkg lower by 16.2 mkg from previous year. The decline in production in North India and South India was 1.6 mkg and 14.6 mkg respectively. The steep fall in production in south India after a one year reprieve from the low crop trap is a matter of concern. \nKerala accounts for 5.03 per cent of the area and 6.3 percent of the total domestic production of tea in the country. The production of tea in the State has been consistently falling since 2009-10. There was a slight improvement in 2012-13 as tea production recorded an increase of 5059 MT despite a decline in area of 18 per cent. This increase in production was mainly on account of increase in productivity. Tea production recorded an increase of 3.5 per cent in 2014-15 also but in 2015-16 there was a decline in production by 11.16 percent. Details given in Appendix 2.14\nThe major issues affecting the tea industry are stagnant productivity, acute labour shortage, high cost of machines, and lack of indigenous machinery.\nCardamom\nIndia is the second largest producer of small cardamom and plays an important role in the international trade of cardamom. The output of cardamom is dependent on prevailing climatic conditions as the cardamom plant requires intermittent spells of rains and good sunshine during the growth stage. Cardamom production in the country during 2015-16 was estimated at 22 thousand tonnes compared to 18 thousand tonnes in 2014-15, an increase of 4 thousand tonnes. The turnaround in cardamom prices since 2006-07 continued up to 2010-11 reaching the highest level, but thereafter the prices have fluctuated. During 2015-16 (August-June), the prices increased by  107.33 per kg to reach 754.00 per kg. \nMeanwhile in Kerala, cardamom production has increased by 21.8 per cent in 2015-16 despite the area under cultivation remaining stagnant. \nPulses",

Pulses are important source of protein, high in fibre content and provide ample quantity of vitamins and minerals. Keeping in view large benefits of pulses for human health, the United Nations proclaimed 2016 as the International Year of Pulses. Thus, due attention is required to enhance the production of pulses not only to meet the dietary requirement of protein but also to raise the awareness about pulses for achieving nutritional, food security and environmental sustainability. Pulses are important component to sustain the agriculture production as the crops posses wide adaptability to fit into various cropping systems and improves the soil fertility.\nIndia's share is 25 per cent in production, about 33 per cent in acreage and \r\n              about 27 per cent in consumption of the total pulses in the world. \r\n              The acreage ranged from 20.35 million ha (2000-01) to 23.99 million \r\n              ha (2012-13) and production varied from 11.08 million tonnes (2000-01) \r\n              to 18.45 million tonnes (2012-13). The productivity has increased \r\n              from 544 kg/ha (2000-01) to 750 kg/ha (2012-13). The major pulses \r\n              producing states are Madhya Pradesh (25 per cent), Uttar Pradesh \r\n              (13 per cent), Maharashtra (12 per cent), Rajasthan (11 per cent), \r\n              Andhra Pradesh (9 per cent) and other states together (30 per cent) \r\n              during 2012-13.\nIn Kerala, pulses are cultivated in autumn, winter and summer seasons. The area under the cultivation of pulses shows a declining trend in the state. During 1975-76, the total area under pulses including tur was 37,485 ha but by 2015-16 it has come down to 3764 ha. Apart from tur, the other main pulses grown in Kerala are cow pea, black gram horse gram and green gram. Major cultivation of pulses and tur is in Palakkad district and contributes to 30 per cent of the total production in the State. The production of pulses in the State was highest during the year 2005-06. More proactive steps are needed to augment pulse production in the State. Details pertaining to the  sector is given in Appendix 2.15 and Appendix 2.16\nCollective farming through Kudumbashree\nCollective farming is an important area of Kudumbasree, which aims at food security both at household and community level. The major crops cultivated are paddy, vegetables, banana, pineapple and tubers. In 2013-14, area brought under cultivation of paddy was 15078.60 ha, of vegetables was 12555.60 ha and of other crops (banana, pineapple and tubers) was 22476.20 ha. Details of area covered are given in Appendix 2.17. More hand holding including facilitation with banks and technology support are essential for improving livelihood of the women groups involved in farming.\nKey initiatives of the Department of Agriculture\nThe annual plan schemes for 2016-17 were formulated focusing on the thrust \r\n              areas and strategies for increasing the productivity in agriculture \r\n              from the current levels.
