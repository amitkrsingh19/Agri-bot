## ðŸš€ Future Aspects and Roadmap
### The current LangGraph architecture is designed for immediate functionality. The primary future goal is to achieve Domain Specialization and Cost Optimization by transitioning from generic LLMs to a custom, fine-tuned Agricultural Language Model.

## 1. Model Specialization and Replacement
| Current Model (llama3.2:3b)|Future Model (Specialized) |	Rationale|
|:---------------------------:|:------------------------:|:---------:|
|Llama 3 (or any generic LLM) |	Hugging Face Fine-tuned Agricultural Model	General LLMs often "hallucinate" or provide generic advice. A fine-tuned model, trained specifically on agricultural reports, local data, and best practices, will drastically increase factual accuracy (reducing hallucinations) and provide domain-specific depth in its responses.|

## 2. Low-Cost Fine-Tuning Strategy (The Method)
#### To achieve the custom model without incurring high costs, the project will implement Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques, which are ideal for student projects with limited GPU access.

- PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning): This method involves freezing the majority of the pre-trained model's weights and only training a small, new set of parameters (adapters) for the agricultural task.

#### Benefit: Reduces training time and computational cost by orders of magnitude compared to full fine-tuning.

- LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation): This is the specific technique to implement PEFT. LoRA injects small, trainable matrices (adapters) into the attention layers of the base model.

#### Benefit: Reduces the number of trainable parameters by up to 10,000 times, allowing fine-tuning to be performed even on consumer-grade GPUs or free cloud environments (like Google Colab/Kaggle). The resulting adapter file is also very small (e.g., a few hundred MBs), making it easy to share.

## 3. Expansion of LangGraph Logic
#### Multi-Modal Node: Integrate a computer vision model (also likely from Hugging Face) to create a new node. The user could upload an image of a diseased crop, and the agent routes the image to the Vision Node for diagnosis and then to the Agricultural Agent for a recommendation.

#### Human-in-the-Loop Node: Introduce a step in the LangGraph where the user or an extension officer can provide feedback on a critical answer, saving the correction to the RAG knowledge base for future use.
