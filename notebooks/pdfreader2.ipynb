Earlier schemes of\\n\\nGovernment of India have emphasis on\\ncrossbreeding for enhancing milk production in the\\ncountry. Scheme is important for upliftment of\\nrural poor as more than 80% low producing\\nindigenous animals are with small and marginal\\nfarmers and landless labours.\\n\\n\\nThe scheme has been playing important role in\\nenhancing milk production and productivity of\\nbovines to meet growing demand of milk and\\nmaking dairying more remunerative to the rural\\nfarmers of the country. The scheme has been\\nleading to multiplication of elite animals of\\nindigenous breeds and increased availability of\\nindigenous stock.\\n\\n\\nDue to implementation of scheme and other\\nmeasures taken by Government of India, the\\nannual growth rate of milk production in the\\ncountry during 2014-15 to 2023-24 is 5.69% over the\\npast 10 years whereas, World milk production is\\ngrowing at 2% per annum. Productivity of all\\ncategory of animals including descript nondescript cattle, buffaloes and crossbred cattle has\\nincreased by 25.74 % from 1647 kg per animal per\\n\\n\\n\\nyear during 2014-15 to 2071 kg per animal per year\\nin 2023-24 which is highest productivity growth\\nrate in the World. Similarly productivity of\\nbuffaloes has increased from 1792 kg per animal per\\nyear in 2013-14 to 2161 kg per animal per year in\\n2023-24. Number of animals in milk has increased\\n\\nfrom 84.08 million in 2013-14 to 111.76 million in\\n\\n2023-24 that is by 32.93%. Indigenous cattle\\n(descript and non descript cattle) has increased by\\n25% during the same period. Milk production from\\nindigenous cattle has increased from 28.13 million\\ntonnes in 2013-14 to 49.91 million tonnes in 2023-24\\n\\nthat is by 77.42%. The per capita availability of milk\\nis 471 grams per day in 2023-24 as against the World\\naverage of 394 grams per day. Per capita availability\\nhas increased from 319 grams per person per day in\\n2014-15 to 471 grams per person per day in 2023-24\\nshowing a growth of 47.64%.\\n\\n\\nThe graphs below show the increase in milk\\nproduction in India over the years from 84 MMT in\\n2001-02 to 239.30 MMT in 2023-24.

Any producer can become\\na DCS member by buying a share and committing\\nto sell milk only to the society. Each DCS has a milk\\ncollection centre where members take milk every\\nday. Each member's milk is tested for quality with\\npayments based on the percentage of fat and SolidsNot Fat (SNF). At the end of each year, a portion of\\nthe DCS profits is used to pay each member a\\npatronage bonus based on the quantity of milk\\npoured.\\n\\n\\n**The District Union:** A District Cooperative Milk\\nProducers' Union is owned by dairy cooperative\\nsocieties. The Union buys all the societies' milk,\\nthen processes and markets fluid milk and\\nproducts. Most Unions also provide a range of\\ninputs and services to DCSs and their members:\\nfeed, veterinary care, artificial insemination to\\nsustain the growth of milk production and the\\ncooperatives' business.

NDDB-DS\\nhas successfully set up 22 MPOs. Among the 22\\nMPOs six were supported under the National Dairy\\nPlan (Phase I). Fifteen of these 22 MPOs have an allwomen membership and all the producer directors\\non their respective boards are women. Together,\\nthese MPOs have around 10.05 lakh milk producers\\nspread over about 24,116 villages. 73.54 per cent of\\nthese producers are women and 65 per cent are\\nsmall holder milk producers. The members of these\\norganisations raised around Rs.233 crore towards\\nshare capital. They have together procured about\\n46.77 lakh Kg of milk per day during 2023-24 and\\ntogether achieved a gross turnover of about Rs.\\n9119 crore during the year. In the MPOs technically\\nsupported by NDS, productivity enhancement\\nactivities such as Artificial Insemination and Ration\\n\\nBalancing Programmes were undertaken in\\naddition to Capacity Building activities like Farmer\\nWorkshops, Dairy Farm Management training. To\\npromote antibiotic-free milk, NDDB-DS has\\ninitiated the use of ethno-veterinary practices in\\nthese MPOs. During the year, more than 13.09 lakh\\nAIs were carried out in the operational areas of\\nthese MPOs.

The\\nper capita availability of milk has reached a level of\\n471 grams per day during the year 2023-24 which is\\nmore than the world average of around 329 grams\\nper day in 2023 (estimates) (Food Outlook Nov'24).\\nMost of the milk in the country is produced by\\nsmall, marginal farmers and landless labourers.\\n\\n\\n**4.1.1 Economic Significance of Dairying**\\n\\n\\nLivestock sub-sector plays a vital role in the Indian\\neconomy and also in the socio-economic\\ndevelopment of millions of rural households.\\nLivestock is a principal source of draught power in\\nrural areas and provides milk, meat, eggs, wool,\\nhides & skins, manure and fuel. it is accounted for\\nabout 5.50% of total GVA of India (at current prices)\\nand 30.23% of the GVA of agriculture & allied\\nsector.

Organized sector comprises\\nof government, producers' owned institutions\\n(milk cooperatives & milk producer organization)\\nand private players which provides fair and\\ntransparent system of milk collection round the\\nyear at the village level. The total size of dairy\\nmarket was about Rs.18.98 lakh crore in 2024. and is\\n\\nexpected to reach a market size of about Rs. 57.00\\nlakh crore by 2033 as per IMARC 2025 report.\\n\\n\\n**4.1.3 Demand**\\n\\n\\nThe drivers of demand for milk in India are \\npopulation growth, urbanization and increasing\\nper capita income. The consumption of milk has\\n\\n\\n71 **Annual Report 2024-25**\\n\\n\\nbeen rising, commensurate with the increase in\\npurchasing power of people, changing food habits\\n& life-styles and demographic growth. Milk with its\\nvaried benefits is a primary source of protein for the\\nlargely vegetarian population of the country.\\nFurther, factors such as increased consumer interest\\nin high protein diets and increasing awareness &\\navailability of dairy products through channels\\nsuch as organized retail chain are also driving this\\ngrowth.\\n\\n\\nThe milk consuming population has been\\nconsistently rising in the country both in rural and\\nurban areas. According to Household Consumer\\nExpenditure Survey (HCES, 2022-23) of NSSO,\\nabout 93% and 95% of rural and urban population\\nrespectively reported consumption of milk and\\nmilk products in the country. The growth in above\\nfactors indicates that the demand for milk & milk\\n\\nproducts will rise consistently in future.\\n\\n\\n**4.1.4 Organised Sector**\\n\\n\\n**4.1.4.1 Cooperative Sector**\\n\\n\\n**Three tier structure**\\n\\n\\n**Village Cooperative Society:** The main pattern\\nfollowed by Village Cooperative Societies in India\\nis an Anand model village dairy cooperative society\\n(DCS) of milk producers. Any producer can become\\na DCS member by buying a share and committing\\nto sell milk only to the society. Each DCS has a milk\\ncollection centre where members take milk every\\nday. Each member's milk is tested for quality with\\npayments based on the percentage of fat and SolidsNot Fat (SNF). At the end of each year, a portion of\\nthe DCS profits is used to pay each member a\\npatronage bonus based on the quantity of milk\\npoured.\\n\\n\\n**The District Union:** A District Cooperative Milk\\nProducers' Union is owned by dairy cooperative\\nsocieties.

NDDB-DS\\nhas successfully set up 22 MPOs. Among the 22\\nMPOs six were supported under the National Dairy\\nPlan (Phase I). Fifteen of these 22 MPOs have an allwomen membership and all the producer directors\\non their respective boards are women. Together,\\nthese MPOs have around 10.05 lakh milk producers\\nspread over about 24,116 villages. 73.54 per cent of\\nthese producers are women and 65 per cent are\\nsmall holder milk producers. The members of these\\norganisations raised around Rs.233 crore towards\\nshare capital. They have together procured about\\n46.77 lakh Kg of milk per day during 2023-24 and\\ntogether achieved a gross turnover of about Rs.\\n9119 crore during the year. In the MPOs technically\\nsupported by NDS, productivity enhancement\\nactivities such as Artificial Insemination and Ration\\n\\nBalancing Programmes were undertaken in\\naddition to Capacity Building activities like Farmer\\nWorkshops, Dairy Farm Management training. To\\npromote antibiotic-free milk, NDDB-DS has\\ninitiated the use of ethno-veterinary practices in\\nthese MPOs. During the year, more than 13.09 lakh\\nAIs were carried out in the operational areas of\\nthese MPOs. Additionally, about 1.23 lakh MT of\\ncattle feed and 894 MT of mineral mixture were also\\n\\nsold among the members of the various MPOs.\\n\\n\\n**4.1.4.4 Private Dairy Sector**\\n\\n\\nPost 1991, when the era of reform in industrial\\nlicensing began, the private sector companies have\\nmade an impressive growth in building capacities\\nfor processing milk and milk derivatives. They\\nmade large investment in dairy sector creating\\ncapacities which surpassed the combined capacity\\nof the dairy cooperatives and the government\\ndairies in past 20 years. Some of these private\\nplayers are now much larger than some cooperative\\ndairies and they have large potential for growth.\\nSince private sector functions purely on\\n\\n\\ncommercial lines with an aim to earn maximum\\n\\nprofit, the social responsibility towards farmers'\\ndevelopment is largely affected. The private\\nplayers prefer to procure milk through vendors\\naffecting the farmers' getting remunerative price.\\nHowever, growth in private sector provides market\\naccess to large number of farmers. The total number\\nof Private Dairies (Milk Processing Units) as Per\\nFSSAI Licenses (Till March 2024) the processing\\ncapacity is 1164 LLPD.\\n\\n\\n**4.2 Role of Dairy Division**\\n\\n\\n(i) Formulation of policy framework, action plan\\nand schemes for Dairy Development in the\\ncountry\\n\\n\\n(ii) Increasing share of organised dairy sector\\n\\nthrough improvement in infrastructure for\\nprocurement, processing and marketing of\\nmilk and milk products.\\n\\n\\n(iii) Scientific and technical consultation and\\n\\ncoordination for dairy development policy\\nframework with line Ministries, Central\\nInstitutes, Technical Universities/Colleges etc.\\n\\n\\n(iv) Techno-economic appraisal, approval,\\n\\nimplementation, monitoring and evaluation of\\nDairy Development schemes of Central\\nGovernment through various Central and\\nState Govt.

The disease is\\ncharacterized by mild fever for 2-3 days followed\\nby development of stiff, round cutaneous nodules\\n(2-5 cm in diameter). Animal often recovered\\nwithin a period of 2-3 weeks. The morbidity rate is\\naround 10-20% and mortality rate is around 1-5%.\\n\\n\\nIn India, lumpy skin disease was initially\\nconfirmed in the states of West Bengal and Odisha\\nduring September, 2019 by NIHSAD, Bhopal. The\\ndisease was later confirmed in the other states.\\n\\nAdvisories and guidelines developed by the\\ndepartment in respect to biosecurity measures,\\ntreatment, surveillance, diagnosis and vaccination\\n\\n\\n\\n(carpet and controlled) issued to all affected and\\nnon-affected states/UTs for taking necessary action\\nincluding timeline for annual vaccination using\\ngoatpox vaccine (Uttarkashi strain). Central teams\\nalso deputed to give necessary guidance and\\ntechnical support to affected states on ground for\\nbetter planning in the field.\\n\\n\\nDuring 2024, the disease was observed in West\\nBengal, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh,\\nRajasthan, Karnataka, Goa, Madhya Pradesh,\\nOdisha, Sikkim, Kerala, and Maharashtra.\\n\\n\\nAround 8.54 crore cattle have been vaccinated\\n\\nduring 2024-25. There was 95% recovery rate of the\\naffected animals owing mainly due to biosecurity\\nand vaccination.\\n\\n\\n**6.3.2 Avian Influenza**\\n\\n\\nSince 2006, the country has been reporting H5N1\\nAvian Influenza virus.

Thus, it is a\\nmajor step forward in realizing the vision of\\n“Digital India” and promoting ease of doing\\nbusiness.\\n\\n\\n**c)** **The objectives of the system are to:**\\n\\n\\ni) Provide convenience to all vendors/\\nsuppliers of the Government to submit their\\nbills/claims at any time, from anywhere.\\n\\n\\nii) Eliminate physical interface between\\nsuppliers and Government officers.\\n\\n\\niii) Enhance efficiency in processing of\\nbills/claims.\\n\\n\\niv) Reduce discretion in processing of bills\\nthrough “First-In-First-Out” (FIFO)\\nmethod.\\n\\n\\n**d)** Currently, the suppliers of various goods\\nand services to the Government have to\\n\\nsubmit physical, ink signed copies of their\\nbills to the respective Ministries/\\nDepartments /Offices of the Government of\\nIndia. Similarly, the government employees\\n\\n\\n\\nalso need to submit hard copies of their\\nclaims.

The vendor/\\nsupplier would be able to track the status of\\nprocessing of their bills online. Thus, the\\nnew system will bring in lot of efficiency and\\ntransparency in the system and is a big\\ncitizen-centric decision of the Government\\n\\nof India.\\n\\n\\n**g)** The e-bill system has been developed by the\\nPublic Financial Management System\\n(PFMS) Division in the office of the\\nController General of Accounts in the\\n\\nDepartment of Expenditure, Ministry of\\nFinance. The bills will be processed by FirstIn-First-Out (FIFO) method.\\n\\n\\nh) In addition to promoting ease of doing\\nbusiness and bringing convenience to lakhs\\nof vendors/suppliers, the e-Bill system will\\nbe environment friendly, eliminating the\\nneed to submit crores of paper bills annually\\nand will thus save tonnes of paper every\\nyear.
