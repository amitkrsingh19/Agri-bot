**OVERVIEW OF**
##### **CHAPTER- 1**

**ACHIEVEMENTS**



**1.1** Animal husbandry and dairying are key
contributors to the Indian economy. Livestock
sector contributes 30.23% of agricultural GVA and
5.5% of the national economy. As the world's
largest milk producer, the sector ensures food
security, generates employment and supports rural
development by providing income and insurance
against crop failures. It empowers women, boosts
foreign exchange through exports, and fosters
sustainability through integrated farming.
Additionally, it supports diverse rural enterprises,
enhancing livelihoods and socio-economic stability
across India.


**1.2** Livestock production and agriculture share
a symbiotic relationship, evolving together as key
components of sustainable food systems. Beyond
their traditional roles, the livestock sector now
emerges as a driver of innovation and resilience in
rural economies. By integrating modern practices
like climate-smart livestock farming, renewable
energy generation through biogas, and
regenerative grazing systems, it contributes to
environmental sustainability. Moreover, livestock
serves as a platform for entrepreneurship,
particularly for women and marginalized groups,
fostering financial inclusion and equitable growth.



**1.3** Impact of livestock manure on soil health,
highlighting its benefits for soil chemical, physical,
and biological properties. Manure enhances soil
fertility by improving nutrient availability, organic
matter content, and cation exchange capacity while
reducing bulk density and increasing porosity. It
positively influences soil water retention,
infiltration, and erosion resistance. Additionally,
manure supports microbial diversity and activity,
crucial for nutrient cycling and soil productivity.
However, the effects depend on manure type,
application rate, and environmental conditions.
While manure provides a sustainable alternative to
synthetic fertilizers, challenges like nutrient runoff
and variability in outcomes underscore the need for
proper management practices.


**1.4** According to Periodic Labour Force Survey
(PLFS) conducted during July, 2022- June, 2023 and
July, 2023- June, 2024, estimated percentage of
workers in usual status (ps+ss) engaged in industry
group 014 (Animal production) and Industry
Group 015 (Mixed farming) of National Industry
Classification (NIC-2008) is given in table below:


**Table 1: Percentage of usually working persons (ps+ss) engaged in Industry Group 014 and**

**015 of NIC-2008 during PLFS 2022-23 & 2023-24**











|Industry group (3-digit code)<br>as per NIC- 2008)|Description of<br>IndustryGr oup|percentage of usually<br>working persons (ps+s s)<br>2022-23|percentage of usually<br>workingpersons (ps+s s)<br>2023-24|
|---|---|---|---|
|014|Animal production|6.45|6.34|
|015|Mixed farming|3.63|4.34|


_Source: Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) Report, 2022-23 & 2023-24, MoSPI_



The data shows a slight decline in the workforce for
animal production (6.45% to 6.34%) and a notable
increase in mixed farming (3.63% to 4.34%) from
2022-23 to 2023-24. This suggests a shift towards
diversification, while animal production may need
targeted interventions to address its challenges.


**Explanatory Note:**


(I) Definition of worker (employed persons):

Persons who, during the reference period,



were engaged in any economic activity or who,
despite their attachment to economic activity,
temporarily abstained from work for reasons
of illness, injury or other physical disability,
bad weather, festivals, social or religious
functions or other contingencies constituted
workers.


(ii) Definition of usual status worker ( **Principal**

**Status and the Subsidiary Status** ) : The
workers in the usual status (ps+ss) are


3 **Annual Report 2024-25**


obtained by considering the usual principal
status (ps) and the subsidiary status (ss)
together. The workers in the usual status
(ps+ss) include (a) the persons who worked for
a relatively long part of the 365 days preceding
the date of survey and (b) the persons from
among the remaining population who had
worked at least for 30 days during the
reference period of 365 days preceding the
date of survey.


**1.5** India's vast livestock and poultry resources, as

detailed in the 20 Livestock Census, underline th
their pivotal socio-economic role, particularly in
rural areas. The 303.76 million bovines (including
cattle, buffalo, mithun, and yak) signify the
backbone of dairy production and draught power
in agriculture. Sheep (74.26 million) and goats
(148.88 million) contribute to meat, milk, and wool
production, essential for arid and semi-arid
regions, while pigs (9.06 million) cater to niche
markets in northeastern and tribal areas. The

dominant poultry population (851.81 million)



underscores its critical role in providing affordable
protein through eggs and meat.


Analyzing the data reveals significant diversity in
species distribution, each adapted to regional
climatic and cultural needs, supporting both
subsistence and commercial farming. The livestock
sector is a vital contributor to India's agricultural,
providing employment, income stability, and a
buffer against crop failures, particularly for small
and marginal farmers. However, challenges like
feed scarcity, disease outbreaks, and climate
vulnerabilities hinder their full potential. Strategic
interventions in breed improvement, veterinary
services, climate-resilient practices, and market
access can amplify productivity and sustainability.
Furthermore, the sector's alignment with global
demand for animal products positions it as a key
driver for economic growth and rural development
in India. The species wise population of animals in
Livestock and Poultry population during the last
two Censuses is given in Table 1.2.

**3.1** **Rashtriya Gokul Mission**


Rashtriya Gokul Mission has been initiated in
December 2014 exclusively for development and
conservation of indigenous bovine breeds in a
scientific holistic manner. Earlier schemes of

Government of India have emphasis on
crossbreeding for enhancing milk production in the
country. Scheme is important for upliftment of
rural poor as more than 80% low producing
indigenous animals are with small and marginal
farmers and landless labours.


The scheme has been playing important role in
enhancing milk production and productivity of
bovines to meet growing demand of milk and
making dairying more remunerative to the rural
farmers of the country. The scheme has been
leading to multiplication of elite animals of
indigenous breeds and increased availability of
indigenous stock.


Due to implementation of scheme and other
measures taken by Government of India, the
annual growth rate of milk production in the
country during 2014-15 to 2023-24 is 5.69% over the
past 10 years whereas, World milk production is
growing at 2% per annum. Productivity of all
category of animals including descript nondescript cattle, buffaloes and crossbred cattle has
increased by 25.74 % from 1647 kg per animal per



year during 2014-15 to 2071 kg per animal per year
in 2023-24 which is highest productivity growth
rate in the World. Similarly productivity of
buffaloes has increased from 1792 kg per animal per
year in 2013-14 to 2161 kg per animal per year in
2023-24. Number of animals in milk has increased

from 84.08 million in 2013-14 to 111.76 million in

2023-24 that is by 32.93%. Indigenous cattle
(descript and non descript cattle) has increased by
25% during the same period. Milk production from
indigenous cattle has increased from 28.13 million
tonnes in 2013-14 to 49.91 million tonnes in 2023-24

that is by 77.42%. The per capita availability of milk
is 471 grams per day in 2023-24 as against the World
average of 394 grams per day. Per capita availability
has increased from 319 grams per person per day in
2014-15 to 471 grams per person per day in 2023-24
showing a growth of 47.64%.


The graphs below show the increase in milk
production in India over the years from 84 MMT in
2001-02 to 239.30 MMT in 2023-24. Graph also
shows the increase in productivity of bovines
(Kg/year) from 2014 to 2022. India has shown a
27.39 percent increase in the same, which is the
highest, followed by China, Germany, and
Denmark. It is also interesting to note that
percentage increase in India exceeds the World
average which stands at 13.97 percent.

**3.1.3** **Accelerated Breed Improvement**
**programme:** Under the component, IVF technology
and artificial insemination with sex sorted semen is

being leveraged to produce female calves for the
dairy farmers. IVF is important tool for genetic
upgradation of bovine population at rapid rate,
work which is done in 7 generations (21 years in
case of cattle and buffaloes) can be done in 1
generation (3 years in case of cattle and buffalo)
through IVF. The technology has huge potential in
enhancing farmers' income through production of
only female calves with genetic potential of
producing 4000 kg of milk per lactation thus
increasing farmer's income by many fold. Under
the Accelerated Breed Improvement programme 2
Lakh IVF pregnancies will be established by the end
of the scheme. Subsidy at the rate of Rs 5000 per
assured pregnancy is being made available to
farmers. The programme has already been initiated
in the country.


Sex sorted semen production has been introduced
in the country for production of only female calves
upto 90% accuracy. Use sex sorted semen will be
game changer not only enhancing milk production
but also limiting stray cattle population. During the
project period 51 lakh pregnancies will be
established and subsidy of Rs 750 or 50% of the cost
of sorted semen on assured pregnancy is available
to farmers.



**ii)** **Establishment of Breed Multiplication**
**Farms:** A major constraint for aspiring dairy
farmers is the difficulty of procuring high quality
heifers or milch animals from their local areas. To

address this issue and to attract investment

including entrepreneurship for the dairy sector,

**3.1.6** **Establishment of Sex Sorted Semen**

**Production Facility:**


**3.1.6.1** With mechanization of Agriculture, utility
of male bovines has reduced and farmers are not

willing to maintain Bullocks for agriculture or any
other draft work. Hence, male calves born at farmer
house have become a liability. Due to religious
reasons, culling of male bovines is difficult in most
part of the country. Farmers often let the male
calves free which results into increase in stray
animal population. Only female calves can be
produced (with more than 90% accuracy) by use of
latest technology like Sex Sorted Semen in AI
program. This technology can be a game changer
for India. For the first time in the country sex sorted
semen production facility is being created in the
country. Extensive use of this technology will not
only increase the number of female animals but also
thereby increase farmers' income by sale of female
or through sale of milk and also address the issue of
stray animals.



**3.1.6.2  Present Status**


Five semen stations in Government sector

(Uttarakhand, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar
Pradesh and Tamil Nadu) are operational. Each
semen stations have production capacity to
produce 6 lakh to 10 lakh doses per annum. So far
55.88 lakh doses of sex sorted semen produced at
Government semen stations assisted under

Rashtriya Gokul Mission and 57.33 lakh doses from
Milk Federation, NGO and private semen stations.
Accelerated breed improvement programme using
sex sorted semen is implemented. Under the
programme 51 lakh pregnancies will be established
and subsidy of Rs 750 or 50% of the cost of sorted
semen on assured pregnancy is made available to
farmers. Sex sorted semen production technology
in India has been developed for indigenous breed of
cattle such as Red Sindhi, Tharparkar, Sahiwal, Gir

etc.

**3.1.7 National Bovine Genomic Centre for**

**Indigenous Breeds (NBGC-IB)**


**3.1.7.1** In developed dairy countries genomic
selection is used to enhance milk production and
productivity for attaining faster genetic gain. In
order to increase milk production and productivity
of indigenous cattle, a National Bovine Genomic
Centre has been established in the country. By
using genomic selection indigenous breeds can be
made viable within few generations. This centre
will play crucial role in identification of disease free
High genetic merit bulls of indigenous breeds.


**3.1.7.2** Projects from Indian Council of Agricultural
Research –National Bureau of Animal Genetic

Resources (ICAR-NBAGR) and National Dairy
Development Board (NDDB) were approved.
Efforts have been initiated under Rashtriya Gokul
Mission to develop common genomic chip for
genomic selection of our indigenous breeds of
cattle and buffaloes. The development of chip will
lead to enhancement of milk production by


**Annual Report 2024-25** 44



increasing rate of genetic gain as animals with
superior genetics can be selected at younger age
whereas, in traditional methods genetic worth of
the animals is proven after 6 to 7 years.


**3.1.7.3 Progress made**


DNA chip for genomic selection namely Indus chip
and Buff chip has been developed by NDDB and
low-density chip for cattle and buffalo has been
developed by NBAGR. The Indus chip and buff
chip are now being converged with the chip
developed by NBAGR for undertaking genomic
selection of indigenous breeds with more
reliability.


**Launch of Indigenously Developed Genomic**
**Chip** : For the first time genomic chip has been
developed for our indigenous breeds under
Rashtriya Gokul Mission. The common genomic
chip with higher reliability has been launched by
Hon'ble PM on 5.10.2024

**3.1.8** **Progeny Testing:**


Milk production is a sex-limitedtrait, therefore
genetic potential of the bull is estimated by the
performance of the daughters. The scientific
breeding method for estimating predicted
transmitting ability of bulls on daughters'
performance is termed as progeny testing.
Organized Progeny Testing Programme (PTP) has
been implemented under Rashtriya Gokul Mission
mainly for indigenous breeds. Details of the
projects implemented under RGM are as under:



**3.1.8.1** **Pedigree Selection Programme:**


Pedigree selection programme has been
implemented under Rashtriya Gokul Mission for
those indigenous breeds which have limited
population and AI infrastructure is also not
available in the area. Under the programme, male
calves are selected on the basis of pedigree details
and performance of dam, sire and other ancestors
in the pedigree. The details of the pedigree
selection programmes implemented under RGM
are as under:

**3.1.10** **Awareness programme:**


**3.1.10.1 Nationwide A.I program**


Nationwide Artificial Insemination Programme
phase IV has been implemented during 2022-24in
592 districts having less than 50% A.I coverage from

1 August 2022 till date. st


**3.1.10.2** The NAIP-III programme has achieved a
significant success by covering 221.72 Lakh bovines
against a target of 3 Crore bovines. Under the
programme 305.94 crore Artificial Inseminations
performed free of cost at farmer's doorstep and
153.25 lakh farmers benefitted. Furthermore, NAIP
programme was extended to phase IV covering 592
districts, under the NAIP-IV till December 2024,

408.86 lakh animals have been covered, 663.14 lakh
AI performed and 243.02 lakh farmers benefitted
under the programme.



Under the programme, AI services are being
delivered at farmers' doorstep free of cost in
identified villages of each districts. For Indigenous
Cattle breeds, HYIB bull semen with dam's
lactation yield above 3000 kgs/lactation is used
under the programme. Upgradation of nondescript cattle with exotic semen and crossbred
with high yielding crossbred semen is also
permitted under the programme as per the State
breeding policy. For this purpose, semen with MSP
of 10,000 Kgs for HF and 6000 Kgs for Jersey is
prescribed. In case of non- descript buffaloes,
semen of Murrah/ Nili-Ravi with MSP of 3000 Kgs
and above is used. The programme will lead to
overall genetic upgradation of bovine population.


**3.1.10.3** All the animals covered under the

programme are being identified using Animal UID
(AUID) and their data are being uploaded on
NDLM data base (Bharat pashudhan). After AI
done, the animal is followed up and all the events
are recorded on the data base till the birth of the calf.


**3.1.10.4 Expected Outcome**


  - Due to this campaign mode approach, around
7.5 Crore number of AI's would result into

worth of 3.00 Crore superior calves, 1.35 Crore
superior female calves will be produced which
will yield 16.2 MMT of milk /annum after 3
years. Cows and buffaloes worth, Rs. 54,000
Crores (Rs. 40,000 per adult cow) will be added
to the farmers household.


  - Through sale of milk, dairy farmers will earn
an additional income of Rs. 55258 Crore.


  - There will be improvement in the indigenous
breed population by the addition of more
milch animals to the dairy herd of the country.

**3.2** **Breed Improvement Institutes**


**3.2.1** **Introduction:**


Central Cattle Development Organizations include
seven Central Cattle Breeding Farms, one Central
Frozen Semen Production and Training Institute
and four Central Herd Registration Units
established in different regions of the country to
produce genetically superior bull calves, quality
frozen semen from High Genetic Merit Bulls
(HGM) and for identification and location of
superior germplasm of indigenous breeds of cattle
and buffaloes, so as to meet the requirement of
HGM bulls and frozen semen doses in the country.
These organizations are also playing important role
in training of manpower in frozen semen
technology and training of farmers and
entrepreneurs in farm management.


**3.2.2** **Central Cattle Breeding Farms (CCBFs)**


**3.2.2.1** Breeding is one of the important tools to
facilitate production potentials and bring about
progressive genetic improvement in production on
a long-term basis in animals. Central Cattle
Breeding Farms were introduced by Govt. of India
in various agro climatic zones of the country



between 1968 to 1976 under various five-year plans.
Their main aim is to make available germplasm
with high genetic potential of important
indigenous and exotic cattle breeds (Holstein
Friesian and Jersey) within the country so as to
serve as a backbone of the dairy industry. These
farms have played crucial role in supply of
breeding inputs in the form of disease free HGM
bulls of indigenous and exotic breeds and frozen
semen doses.


**3.2.2.2** There are seven Central Cattle Breeding
Farms (CCBFs) located at Alamadhi (Tamil Nadu),
Andeshnagar (UP), Chiplima&Sunabeda (Odisha),
Dhamrod (Gujarat), Hessarghatta (Karnataka) and
Suratgarh (Rajasthan). These CCBFs are engaged
in scientific breeding of cattle and buffaloes with
the aim of production of high pedigreed bulls for
genetic upgradation programmes. Besides, these
farms are also providing awareness training to the
farmers and breeders.


As per decision taken by the Ministry with effect
from 01.04.2023 technical management of three
farms i.e. CCBF-Alamadhi, CCBF-Andeshnagar&
CCBF-Dhamrod have been transferred to National

Dairy Development Board(NDDB) to establish
Dairy Innovation Centre's as Centre of Excellence
by creating additional infrastructure and
modernization of farms and perform all activities as
per guidelines of Rashtriya Gokul Mission (RGM).


**3.2.2.3** These farms are producing high
pedigreed bull calves of indigenous, exotic breeds



55 **Annual Report 2024-25**


of cattle and important buffalo breeds for
distribution to State Governments, Breeding
Agencies, NGOs, Co-operatives etc. The bull calves
are produced from indigenous breeds viz.
Tharparkar, Red Sindhi, Exotic Breeds viz. Jersey,
Holstein Friesian, Buffalo breeds viz. Murrah
andSurti and crossbred bulls of Jersey X Red Sindhi
and Holstein Friesian X Tharparkar.


**3.2.2.4 Objectives:**


Mandate of these farms is as under:


(i) Progressive genetic improvement of herd for
Milk Production and other important traits
like calving interval, days open and days dry
through scientific selection and organized

**Annual Report 2024-25** 70


##### **DAIRY DEVELOPMENT CHAPTER- 4**



**4.1 Overview**


The Dairy sector in India has grown substantially
over the years. As a result of prudent policy
interventions, India ranks first among the world's
milk producing nations, achieving an annual
production of 239.30 million tonnes during the year
2023-24 as compared to 230.58 million tonnes
during 2022-23 recording a growth rate of 3.78%.


Dairying has become an important secondary
source of income for millions of rural families and

has assumed the most important role in providing
employment and income generating opportunities
particularly for women and marginal farmers. The
per capita availability of milk has reached a level of
471 grams per day during the year 2023-24 which is
more than the world average of around 329 grams
per day in 2023 (estimates) (Food Outlook Nov'24).
Most of the milk in the country is produced by
small, marginal farmers and landless labourers.


**4.1.1 Economic Significance of Dairying**


Livestock sub-sector plays a vital role in the Indian
economy and also in the socio-economic
development of millions of rural households.
Livestock is a principal source of draught power in
rural areas and provides milk, meat, eggs, wool,
hides & skins, manure and fuel. it is accounted for
about 5.50% of total GVA of India (at current prices)
and 30.23% of the GVA of agriculture & allied
sector. The contribution of agriculture & allied
sector to the national GVA has been falling from a
level of 25.17% in 1999-20 to 18.19% in 2022-23 (at



As per the FAO Dairy Market Review (2024) the
world milk production will grow from 966.6
million tonnes in 2023 (estimates) to 981.1 million
tonnes in 2024 (Nov.) which translated to a growth
of 1.5 %. Further as per the Basic Animal
Husbandry Statistics-2024 milk production of India
is estimated to reach 254.19 million tonnes in 2024
25 registering a growth of 6.22% (estimated) over
the last year beating the world average growth rate.


current price). However, the contribution of
livestock sector to the total GVA has increased from

4.7% to 5.5% during the same period (at current
price).


**4.1.2 Share of milk production and supply**


In India, about 37% of the milk produced is either
consumed at the producer level or sold to nonproducers in the rural area, the balance 63% of the
milk is available for sale to organized and
unorganized players. Organized sector comprises
of government, producers' owned institutions
(milk cooperatives & milk producer organization)
and private players which provides fair and
transparent system of milk collection round the
year at the village level. The total size of dairy
market was about Rs.18.98 lakh crore in 2024. and is

expected to reach a market size of about Rs. 57.00
lakh crore by 2033 as per IMARC 2025 report.


**4.1.3 Demand**


The drivers of demand for milk in India are 
population growth, urbanization and increasing
per capita income. The consumption of milk has


71 **Annual Report 2024-25**


been rising, commensurate with the increase in
purchasing power of people, changing food habits
& life-styles and demographic growth. Milk with its
varied benefits is a primary source of protein for the
largely vegetarian population of the country.
Further, factors such as increased consumer interest
in high protein diets and increasing awareness &
availability of dairy products through channels
such as organized retail chain are also driving this
growth.


The milk consuming population has been
consistently rising in the country both in rural and
urban areas. According to Household Consumer
Expenditure Survey (HCES, 2022-23) of NSSO,
about 93% and 95% of rural and urban population
respectively reported consumption of milk and
milk products in the country. The growth in above
factors indicates that the demand for milk & milk

products will rise consistently in future.


**4.1.4 Organised Sector**


**4.1.4.1 Cooperative Sector**


**Three tier structure**


**Village Cooperative Society:** The main pattern
followed by Village Cooperative Societies in India
is an Anand model village dairy cooperative society
(DCS) of milk producers. Any producer can become
a DCS member by buying a share and committing
to sell milk only to the society. Each DCS has a milk
collection centre where members take milk every
day. Each member's milk is tested for quality with
payments based on the percentage of fat and SolidsNot Fat (SNF). At the end of each year, a portion of
the DCS profits is used to pay each member a
patronage bonus based on the quantity of milk
poured.


**The District Union:** A District Cooperative Milk
Producers' Union is owned by dairy cooperative
societies. The Union buys all the societies' milk,
then processes and markets fluid milk and
products. Most Unions also provide a range of
inputs and services to DCSs and their members:
feed, veterinary care, artificial insemination to
sustain the growth of milk production and the
cooperatives' business. Union staff train and
provide consulting services to support DCS leaders
and staff.


**The State Federation:** The cooperative milk
producers' unions in a state form, a State
Federation, which is responsible for marketing the
fluid milk and products of member unions. Some


**Annual Report 2024-25** 72



federations also manufacture feed and support
other union activities.


**4.1.4.2 Current status:** In the cooperative sector,
there are 22 Milk Federations, 241 district
cooperative milk unions, 28 marketing dairies, 25
Milk Producer Organizations covering about 2.35
lakh villages and 1.72 Crore dairy farmers as
members.


**4.1.4.3 Milk Producer Organizations**


NDDB Dairy Services (NDDB-DS), the not-forprofit wholly owned subsidiary of NDDB had
facilitated incorporation and operationalization of
Milk Producer Organizations (MPOs). NDDB-DS
has successfully set up 22 MPOs. Among the 22
MPOs six were supported under the National Dairy
Plan (Phase I). Fifteen of these 22 MPOs have an allwomen membership and all the producer directors
on their respective boards are women. Together,
these MPOs have around 10.05 lakh milk producers
spread over about 24,116 villages. 73.54 per cent of
these producers are women and 65 per cent are
small holder milk producers. The members of these
organisations raised around Rs.233 crore towards
share capital. They have together procured about
46.77 lakh Kg of milk per day during 2023-24 and
together achieved a gross turnover of about Rs.
9119 crore during the year. In the MPOs technically
supported by NDS, productivity enhancement
activities such as Artificial Insemination and Ration

Balancing Programmes were undertaken in
addition to Capacity Building activities like Farmer
Workshops, Dairy Farm Management training. To
promote antibiotic-free milk, NDDB-DS has
initiated the use of ethno-veterinary practices in
these MPOs. During the year, more than 13.09 lakh
AIs were carried out in the operational areas of
these MPOs. Additionally, about 1.23 lakh MT of
cattle feed and 894 MT of mineral mixture were also

sold among the members of the various MPOs.


**4.1.4.4 Private Dairy Sector**


Post 1991, when the era of reform in industrial
licensing began, the private sector companies have
made an impressive growth in building capacities
for processing milk and milk derivatives. They
made large investment in dairy sector creating
capacities which surpassed the combined capacity
of the dairy cooperatives and the government
dairies in past 20 years. Some of these private
players are now much larger than some cooperative
dairies and they have large potential for growth.
Since private sector functions purely on


commercial lines with an aim to earn maximum

profit, the social responsibility towards farmers'
development is largely affected. The private
players prefer to procure milk through vendors
affecting the farmers' getting remunerative price.
However, growth in private sector provides market
access to large number of farmers. The total number
of Private Dairies (Milk Processing Units) as Per
FSSAI Licenses (Till March 2024) the processing
capacity is 1164 LLPD.


**4.2 Role of Dairy Division**


(i) Formulation of policy framework, action plan
and schemes for Dairy Development in the
country


(ii) Increasing share of organised dairy sector

through improvement in infrastructure for
procurement, processing and marketing of
milk and milk products.


(iii) Scientific and technical consultation and

coordination for dairy development policy
framework with line Ministries, Central
Institutes, Technical Universities/Colleges etc.


(iv) Techno-economic appraisal, approval,

implementation, monitoring and evaluation of
Dairy Development schemes of Central
Government through various Central and
State Govt. Agencies including coordination
with International Funding Agencies.


(v) Technical and Scientific work for preparation

of standards and protocols on quality of milk &
milk products and specifications & standards
of dairy machineries with various National
and International Scientific Bodies.





(vi) Trade policy related to milk and milk products

including examination of applications
(scientific and technical) received for import of
milk and milk products for issuing Sanitary
Import Permit under Livestock importation
Act 1998 and S.P.S Measures.


(vii) Monitoring of Milk situation in the country

including policy decisions to maintain supply
of milk & milk products to the consumers at
reasonable prices and ensuring remunerative
price to milk producers through organised
dairy sector.


(viii)Scientific and technical database development

and maintenance for suitable policy
interventions in the sector.


**4.3** **Milk Scenario**


**4.3.1** **Domestic:**


The average milk procurement during the month of
December 2024 was about 3.5% higher and the milk
sale was about 1.6% higher when compared to
December 2023. During December 2024, the stock of
Skimmed Milk Powder (SMP) in cooperative sector
is higher by about 32% and the stock of white butter
increased by about 16% compared to December
2023.


**4.3.2 Achievements made under Dairy**
**Development Sector during last two years**


India is the largest producer of milk and contributes
24% of the World's total milk production. The

**Sectoral growth under National Livestock Mission- Entrepreneurship Development Programme**



**A. Establishment of rural poultry farm under**
**NLM-EDP Scheme- Samarala Shanusha, Andhra**
**Pradesh**


Samarala Shanusha's journey in the world of
poultry farming began four years ago when she
established her own backyard poultry farm. Like
many aspiring entrepreneurs, she dreamed of
expanding her business but faced significant
challenges due to limited financial resources.
However, her path took a transformative turn when


**Annual Report 2024-25** 96



she learned about the National Livestock Mission

(NLM) scheme initiated by the Government of
India, designed to assist individuals like her
striving to grow their enterprises.


With the support of the NLM scheme, Shanusha's
aspirations became attainable. The subsidy she
received proved instrumental in setting up a
comprehensive poultry unit, featuring a variety of
Grampriya and Asil breeds. Shanusha's success
story began with the sale of 100 chicks. The


substantial subsidy of Rs. 12,500,000 provided by
the NLM scheme served as the foundation for

Shanusha's entrepreneurial success. With
increased capital and invaluable support from the
scheme, she went on to employ members of her
local community, generating job opportunities and
contributing to the growth of the local economy.


Before the NLM scheme, securing a loan from
banks had been a daunting challenge for Shanusha.
However, with the support of the scheme, she
gained the confidence to approach the bank and
secure the funds necessary to expand her business.
It was a testament to how government initiatives
like NLM can empower individuals to overcome
financial barriers and realize their entrepreneurial
potential.



Shanusha's poultry farm has not only thrived but
has also become a source of inspiration in her
village, motivating young individuals to embrace
entrepreneurship and pursue their dreams.
Shanusha's next ambitious step involves expanding
her business by setting up shops for selling her
chicks. The National Livestock Mission (NLM)
scheme has profoundly transformed Shanusha's
life by providing her with the essential support and
resources needed to pursue her entrepreneurial
dreams. Her journey is a testament to the scheme's
potential to create sustainable livelihoods and
empower rural entrepreneurs, paving the way for a
brighter and more prosperous future.

size is established at Andhra Pradesh by women entrepreneur.



**B. Establishment of silage making unit under**
**NLM-EDP scheme- Kanchan Verma**


Kanchan Verma, a resilient and determined
woman from Hoshangabad, Madhya Pradesh,
defied conventional norms by venturing into
agriculture and becoming a successful
entrepreneur in the farming sector. Kanchan was
married into a farming family where she imbibed
the essence of agricultural practices. However, her
spirit to break barriers and become self-sufficient
led her to embark on a journey of learning and skill
acquisition. She realized that as a woman farmer,
she shouldn't rely on anyone but herself. This
determination fueled her to master tractor

operation and engage directly in all agricultural

activities.



Kanchan's journey began with cultivating corn for
animal feed, recognizing the demand in the dairy
farming sector. In December 2021, Kanchan applied
for support under the State Dairy Department
scheme. Her application was approved, and she
received a substantial subsidy of Rs. 49.45 Lakhs.
This financial backing enabled her to upgrade her
farming techniques, incorporate machinery for
silage production, and expand her operations. The
support from the Department of Animal
Husbandry and Dairying facilitated her journey
towards sustainable farming practices and
economic growth.


By convincing farmers Kanchan has managed 200
acres of land dedicated to fodder cultivation, with


97 **Annual Report 2024-25**


plans for further expansion in the coming years.
Her entrepreneurial spirit extends beyond farming;
she established an e-commerce platform to market
her produce, enhancing visibility and reaching a
broader customer base. Kanchan's success has not



only empowered her but has also created a ripple
effect, positively impacting over 100 farmers in her
community. Her endeavor has provided an
economic boost, generated job opportunities and
fostering local development.

##### **LIVESTOCK HEALTH CHAPTER- 6**



**6.1** **Overview**


**6.1.1** The rapid growth in livestock production,
combined with high animal density, expanding
livestock populations, increased interactions
between livestock, humans, and wildlife, and the
rise in global trade and movement of livestock,
presents considerable challenges in ensuring the
health of livestock and poultry.


Through livestock health programmes,
particularly animal disease control, DAHD aims to
control and contain zoonotic, emerging and reemerging diseases while ensuring sustainable
production, guiding for optimal livelihoods and
safe & wholesome production of food of animal
origin.


Two-thirds of infectious diseases affecting humans
are of animal origin and three fourths of emerging
human pathogens being animal-based, alongside
the growing challenge of foodborne diseases.


The Department is increasing capacity of animal
health management by building national level
institutional capacities through focused R & D
activities; strengthening state-level capacities via
capacity building of manpower and epidemiology;
improving State diagnostic capabilities, improving
access to veterinary health care services, improving
farm bio-security and sharing advisories for control
and containment of livestock & poultry diseases
e.g. Avian Influenza, Lumpy Skin Disease,
Glanders, African Swine Fever, etc. The
Department also released advisories for animal
management practices during summer, and other
extreme weather conditions as well as for natural

disasters are shared with States/ UTs.


**6.1.2.** The Department enforces regulatory
measures to contain and control diseases through
the “Prevention and Control of Infectious and

Contagious Diseases in Animals Act, 2009”, and
“Livestock Importation Act, 1898” aimed at
prevention of ingress of exotic and emerging
diseases in the country through imports of
livestock and livestock products. The number of



Hospitals, Dispensaries and No. of Veterinary Aid
Centre as on 31.03.2024 is given at **Annexure IX.**


**6.2. Livestock Health & Disease Control**

**Programme (LHDCP)**


Livestock Health & Disease Control Programme
(LHDCP) implemented by the Department, is
ongoing Centrally Sponsored Scheme (CSS) as
revised/modified over the years for prevention of
ingress and spread of animal diseases and aims to
improve animal health by way of implementation
of prophylactic vaccination against diseases of
animals, enhancing delivery of quality Veterinary
services, disease surveillance and strengthening
veterinary infrastructure.


The major activities supported are vaccination
against Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD),
Brucellosis, Peste des Petits Ruminants (PPR) and
Classical Swine Fever (CSF).


During 2021-22, LH&DC scheme was also revised
and realigned to 3 components (i) Critical Animal
Disease Control Programme for control of PPR and
CSF -100% Central Sector (ii) Assistance to States for
Control of Animal Diseases (ASCAD) and
Establishment& Strengthening of Veterinary
Hospitals – Mobile Veterinary Units (ESVHDMVU) – Centrally Sponsored components except
procurement of MVUs which is 100%. The NADCP
and LHDC were merged as components under
LHDCP during 2021-22.


For Mobile Veterinary Units, established with an
aim to deliver last mile delivery of Veterinary
Health Services at the farmers' doorstep, the Central
Government provides 100% financial assistance to
the States/UTs towards procurement and
customization of MVUs to strengthen veterinary
health services in far flung areas.


Assistance to States for Control of Animal Disease

(ASCAD) for control of state prioritized
economically important exotic, emergent and
zoonotic animal diseases is also being
implemented.


107 **Annual Report 2024-25**


The details of LHDCP components are as under:


**6.2.1. National Animal Disease Control**

**Programme (NADCP):**


National Animal Disease Control Programme for
Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) and Brucellosis
(NADCP) was launched by the Department in 2019
with the objective of control of FMD and Brucellosis
through development of herd immunity. National
Animal Disease Control Programme for control of
Foot & Mouth Disease (FMD) and Brucellosis, was
approved by Cabinet as a separate 100% Central
Sector (CS) scheme vide letter no. 17/CM/2019
dated 3rd June, 2019 with an outlay of Rs.13,343.00
Cr for five years from 2019-20 to 2023-24, with an
objective of complete control of FMD by 2025 with
vaccination and its eventual eradication by 2030
and control of Brucellosis. In 2021, this programme
was subsumed under Livestock Health & Disease

Control Programme (LHDCP).


100% central assistance is provided to the States for
purchasing vaccination accessories, remuneration



to vaccinators, development of cold chain
infrastructure (Walk-in-Cold Rooms, Cold
cabinets, ice lined refrigerators, vaccine carriers,
active cool boxes etc.) of the States, surveillance &
monitoring and IEC / awareness campaigns.


**6.2.1.1 NADCP-FMD:**


Foot and Mouth Disease is considered the most

significant from the point of adversely affecting
economically which is estimated to cause economic
loss around Rs. 24,000 crore every year and affects
the acceptability of Indian animal products outside
India. The disease is globally recognized by World
Organization for Animal Health (WOAH) as
priority disease for control and eradication.


During the year 2024-25, total 34.80 crore FMD
vaccine doses were supplied to States/ UTs. During
the period, around 22.36 Crore animal were
vaccinated and around 5.57 Crore farmers were

benefitted.Further, around Rs. 212.99 crore was
released for accessories, awareness, remuneration,
and cold chain equipment.



**Vaccination against FMD**



There is considerable reduction in FMD outbreak in

2024-2025 so far, compared to previous years. FMD
outbreaks has steadily declined from 227 cases in
2018 to 66 outbreaks up to June 2024.


**Annual Report 2024-25** 108



The outbreaks are sporadic in nature and there have
been cases of FMD affecting very limited number of
animals and did not spread due to surrounding
herd immunity.


**6.2.1.2 NADCP-Brucellosis:**


Brucellosis is an economically important
reproductive disease of cattle and buffaloes having
an adverse impact resulting in abortions and is also
transmissible to humans as it is zoonotic. It is also a

serious occupational hazard and endemic in India.



In this component, female bovine calves (4-8
months of age) are vaccinated throughout the
country for providing protection against
Brucellosis.

**emerging diseases**


**6.3.1. Lumpy Skin Disease (LSD)**


Lumpy skin disease (LSD) is an infectious viral
disease of cattle and buffalo caused by capripox
virus. It is transmitted by arthropod vectors such as
mosquitoes, biting flies and ticks. The disease is
characterized by mild fever for 2-3 days followed
by development of stiff, round cutaneous nodules
(2-5 cm in diameter). Animal often recovered
within a period of 2-3 weeks. The morbidity rate is
around 10-20% and mortality rate is around 1-5%.


In India, lumpy skin disease was initially
confirmed in the states of West Bengal and Odisha
during September, 2019 by NIHSAD, Bhopal. The
disease was later confirmed in the other states.

Advisories and guidelines developed by the
department in respect to biosecurity measures,
treatment, surveillance, diagnosis and vaccination



(carpet and controlled) issued to all affected and
non-affected states/UTs for taking necessary action
including timeline for annual vaccination using
goatpox vaccine (Uttarkashi strain). Central teams
also deputed to give necessary guidance and
technical support to affected states on ground for
better planning in the field.


During 2024, the disease was observed in West
Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh,
Rajasthan, Karnataka, Goa, Madhya Pradesh,
Odisha, Sikkim, Kerala, and Maharashtra.


Around 8.54 crore cattle have been vaccinated

during 2024-25. There was 95% recovery rate of the
affected animals owing mainly due to biosecurity
and vaccination.


**6.3.2 Avian Influenza**


Since 2006, the country has been reporting H5N1
Avian Influenza virus. The Government carried out

control and containment operations immediately
and contained the disease. The guidelines were
further devised for Zoological Parks and were
issued to them for necessary action.


Control and containment operations were carried
out as per the guidelines of the extant Action Plan
on Preparedness, Control and Containment of
Avian Influenza, 2021 for the outbreaks of Avian
Influenza (HPAI) at various epicentres.


The Government of India, under the ASCAD
component of LHDCP, will share costs equally
with State governments (50:50). However, no
compensation applies to losses at governmentowned farms.

time to time to be vigilant about the outbreak
of the disease.


(v) Advisories are issued to the states for guidance

of poultry farmers from time to time on
various aspects of disease control, surveillance
and importance of bio security.


**Revision of Compensation Rates for Poultry**


In accordance with the National Action Plan for the

Prevention, Control, and Containment of Avian
Influenza 2021, the culling of poultry birds,
destruction of eggs, and disposal of poultry feed
within a 1-kilometer radius of an outbreak

epicentre is mandated. Farmers affected by these
measures are compensated for their losses as part of
the process.


Following the recommendations of the Technical
Committee of this Department and consultations
with experts and stakeholders held on April 29 and
30, 2024, revised compensation rates were
approved and officially released in September
2024. These updated rates aim to ensure fair
compensation for different poultry species reared
across the country. The last revision of rates
occurred in May 2013.


**6.3.3 AFRICAN SWINE FEVER (ASF) IN PIGS:**


African Swine Fever (ASF) is a highly infectious
and contagious hemorrhagic viral disease of pigs,
and wild boar/feral pigs and other pig species of all
breeds and ages. Mortality rate is as high as 100%.
ASF does not infect human or other livestock

species. It is caused by DNA virus of the



Asfariviridae family, genus Asfivirus. Incubation
period varies from 4 to 19 days.


In India, African Swine Fever (ASF) has been
confirmed by NIHSAD, Bhopal initially in the
States of Arunachal Pradesh and Assam during
June, 2020 and then in NER and the other states of
the country. The Department has framed the
National Action Plan for Control, Containment and
Eradication of African Swine Fever (ASF) in India
and circulated to all stakeholders. States /UTs were
urged for taking suitable actions as contained in the
Action Plan so that African Swine Fever (ASF) is
controlled, contained and eradicated from the
country in a definite timeline. Central Teams also
deputed to give necessary guidance and technical
support to affected states on ground for better
planning in the field. During 2024, the disease was
observed in Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur,
Meghalaya, Nagaland, Sikkim, Tripura, Bihar,
Delhi, Haryana, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Kerala,
Uttarakhand, Madhya Pradesh, Goa, Maharashtra,
Rajasthan, Himachal Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Uttar

biosecurity measures are underway.


**6.3.4** **GLANDERS IN EQUINES:**


Glanders is a contagious and fatal disease of
equines, viz., horses, donkeys and mules, caused by
infection with the bacterium _Burkholderia mallei_ ( _B._
_mallei_ ). Control of Glanders requires testing of
suspect clinical cases, screening of apparently
normal equids, and elimination of reactors _B.mallei_
has zoonotic potential and has been considered as a
potential biological warfare or bioterrorism agent
as it can cause highly fatal disease in humans.


Clinical case of disease Glander

**6.6.2 Animal Quarantine and Certification**
**Service (AQCS)**


The purpose and scope of setting up of Animal
Quarantine Stations is to prevent ingress of exotic
diseases into the country through imported
livestock and livestock products. The increased
and faster international trade and travel exposes
every country to the dangers of infiltration of
known and unknown transmissible animal

diseases which have the potential of rapid spread
and also have adverse socio- economic and

human/animal health consequences. The
Quarantine Services are necessary to keep the
country free from exotic diseases.


There are many infectious diseases of livestock
which are prevalent in other countries but India is
free from them. It is therefore necessary that such
exotic diseases do not gain entry into our country
through movement of livestock and livestock
products from abroad. The entire procedure of
keeping a watch on livestock disease is the
responsibility of the World Organization for
Animal Health, (earlier Office des International
Epizooties (O.I.E.)) through its Terrestrial and
Aquatic Animal Health Codes. OIE has a list of
the prevalent diseases (aquatic and terrestrial).
Zoonosis is also an important component of
AQCS wherein human health is ensured by strict
implementation of AQCS regulations.


An efficient Animal Quarantine Organization is
necessary for conducting checks at international
airports/seaports and land routes as livestock
may covertly carry pathogens without any sign of
clinical disease; they must be held in quarantine
for observation and testing to establish their
pathogen-free status before release into the
country. There are six Animal Quarantine
stations at Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata,
Bengaluru and Hyderabad.

and inclusive methodologies, the Livestock Census
(LC) and Integrated Sample Survey (ISS) emerge as
the twin pillars for generating precise animal
husbandry data, paving the way for sustainable
growth and rural empowerment.


**7.1 Integrated Sample Survey (ISS)**


The Department of Animal Husbandry and
Dairying (DAHD) plays a pivotal role in estimating
the annual production of four Major Livestock
Products (MLP)—Milk, Eggs, Meat, and
Wool—through the Integrated Sample Survey
(ISS). This nationwide scheme ensures the timely
generation of MLP estimates, serving as an
important tool for policy formulation and strategic
planning.


Implemented across all States and Union
Territories (UTs), the scheme benefits from Central
Assistance: 50% for States, 90% for Northeastern
States, and 100% for UTs to cover salaries of entitled



personnel. Additionally, full Central Assistance
supports enumerators and supervisors with
TA/DA for fieldwork, refresher training in ISS
software & methodologies, and the integration of IT
solutions for streamlined operations.


The survey spans from March to February, divided
into three distinct seasons—Summer, Rainy, and
Winter. Seasonal estimates compiled at the
State/UT level are aggregated to produce annual
estimates, which are published in the Annual
Publication on Basic Animal Husbandry Statistics
(BAHS). The latest edition, BAHS 2024, unveiled on
November 26, 2024, presents a comprehensive
analysis of the sector's performance, highlighting
key findings that shape the future of India's
livestock economy.

which is inclusive of breed-specific censuses for all
indigenous breeds registered by ICAR-NBAGR,
further enhancing the country's understanding of
its rich livestock heritage.


**7.2.2 Breed Watchlist 2022**


Based on Breed wise Report of 20 Census th
published by the Department in 2022, NBAGR
prepared the 'Breed Watchlist 2022' for assessing
the risk status of indigenous breeds. As per the
Food & Agriculture Organization (FAO)
guidelines, a total of 38 breeds were identified with
various risk status like 14 breeds under

'vulnerable', 19 breeds under 'endangered' and 5
breeds under 'critical' category identified and listed
in the Watchlist.


**7.2.3 21 Livestock Census Takes Flight** **st**


**India's Most Comprehensive Animal Count**


In an ambitious nationwide initiative, India is
conducting its most extensive livestock
enumeration exercise. Launched in October 2024,
this massive data collection effort deploys an
impressive force of 88,000 enumerators and 15,000
supervisor personnel ensuring comprehensive
coverage across every corner of nation-spanning
urban centers, rural villages, and even the most
remote areas. This ambitious census stands apart,



Breed Watchlist, an outcome of the 20 Livestock th
Census, is important to prioritize breeds for
conservation and development, as a policy input.
The ICAR-NBAGR, as a national repository for
domesticated animals, has cryopreserved the
germplasm (semen/somatic cells) of 26 threatened
breeds in its National Gene Bank for medium- and

long-term conservation. Identifying the indigenous
breeds at risk also fulfil the target for National
Indicator of United Nation's Sustainable

Development Goal of the country.


not only in its extensive scope but also in its
innovative approach, which incorporates modern
methodologies to provide a deeper and more
holistic understanding of the country's livestock
sector. Data collection is being carried out through a
mobile app, enhancing the efficiency and accuracy
of the enumeration process. The app ensures realtime data entry, reducing human error and
streamlining the reporting process. Additionally, a
robust monitoring system is in place to ensure that
data collection adheres to strict guidelines,



139 **Annual Report 2024-25**


providing the highest level of accuracy and
reliability in the results.


A key feature of this census is its dedicated focus on
documenting the socio-economic dynamics of
livestock rearing. For the first time, it also places
emphasis on livestock holding of pastoral
communities, who have long been the backbone of
India's rural economy, as well as the pivotal role of
women in livestock management. By capturing
these often-overlooked aspects, the census aims to
facilitate the formulation of targeted policies for
pastoral communities, and to reveal intricate
relationship between gender, culture, and livestock
production, offering critical insights into the
evolving role of women in rural livelihoods.

The census is meticulously cataloging 16 diverse
species, painting a comprehensive picture of India's
animal wealth: Cattle, buffalo, mithun, yak, sheep,
goats, pigs, horses, ponies, mules, donkeys, and
camels, dogs, rabbits, and elephants, fowl, ducks,
and other avian species.


With approximately 40% of the enumeration
completed till now, this massive exercise is
scheduled to conclude in February 2025. The data
gathered will be instrumental in shaping livestock
development policies, understanding changing
patterns in animal husbandry, and supporting
sustainable agricultural practices across India.

**9.1** The Department is implementing various
Schemes, mainly aimed at strengthening the
infrastructure of the State Governments for the

development of animal husbandry and dairying.
Most of the schemes are not directly beneficiaryoriented. A large population of the country
belonging to the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled
Tribes, other weaker sections of the society and
women are engaged in activities in the livestock
sectors. As a corollary, various schemes
implemented by the Department benefit these
sections of the society. However, the Department is
not maintaining record of beneficiaries belonging
to Scheduled Cates, Scheduled Tribes and women.
Keeping in view the nature of the schemes, the State
Governments / Implementing Agencies are also
not maintaining such record.

**A.** **Establishment of rural poultry farm under**
**NLM-EDP Scheme- Kshama Rani, Karnataka**


At 62, M. Kshama Rani from Sargur village,
Mysuru, embarked on an entrepreneurial journey,
transforming her life and that of thousands through
backyard poultry farming. With support from the
N a t i o n a l L i v e s t o c k M i s s i o n ( N L M )
Entrepreneurship Development Programme, she
built "Namma Mysuru Naati Koli," a thriving
enterprise promoting desi poultry.


Kshama Rani, along with her son Sagar Urs,
established a state-of-the-art hatchery and
breeding farm, scaling operations to a 60,000-chick
capacity per month. Overcoming market
challenges, she bridged the rural-urban poultry
demand gap, introduced microfinancing, and
provided training to rural farmers, especially
women. Today, her business generates an annual
turnover of 1.48 crore, employing 15 staff and
benefitting over 2,000 farmers.


Today, Kshama Rani's achievements speak
volumes about her dedication and hard work. More

than 2,000 rural farmers, especially women, are
now associated with her business, earning steady
incomes. Her initiative has created employment
opportunities for 15 staff members and empowered
women in rural areas, providing them with a
reliable income source akin to an “ATM” for

emergencies.



Looking ahead, Kshama Rani aims to expand her
operations further. She plans to increase
production by 30% annually and introduce
innovative buyback schemes for vaccinated chicks,
creating a cyclical and sustainable model. By
integrating her business with government
programs, she hopes to enhance rural livelihoods
even further.

subsidy under NLM EDP, she established a pig
farm specializing in breeding. In just two years, her
turnover reached Rs. 30 lakh in FY 2024-25,
generating a profit of Rs. 8 lakh. She has sold 685
piglets and 45 adult pigs, and currently manages
112 sows, 10 boars, and 187 piglets. Her farm's
success is attributed to proper animal care,
nutrition, and vaccination, benefiting local farmers
with healthier livestock for higher profitability.


Priyanki's work has empowered many women and
youth in her village, breaking traditional gender
roles. She employs four workers and motivates
others to explore animal husbandry as an
alternative livelihood. Through her resourcesharing and training programs, she helps fellow
villagers understand the importance of scientific
pig farming. Priyanki is also an active participant in
the "Lakhpati Didi" initiative, promoting women's
financial independence. Her enterprise fosters
rural development and contributes to the overall
socio-economic upliftment of the region.

**14.5 New Initiatives by Ministry of**
**Finance and O/o Controller General of**

**Accounts**


**A.** **e-Bill system'**


a) The Union Minister for Finance & Corporate
Affairs Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman launched

the e-Bill system for Central Government
Ministries on the 46th Civil Accounts Day.
New e-Bill system to enable paperless
submission and end to end digital
processing of bills.


b) In a phased manner, the new system will
make the entire process of submission and
backend processing of bills completely
paperless and transparent. Thus, it is a
major step forward in realizing the vision of
“Digital India” and promoting ease of doing
business.


**c)** **The objectives of the system are to:**


i) Provide convenience to all vendors/
suppliers of the Government to submit their
bills/claims at any time, from anywhere.


ii) Eliminate physical interface between
suppliers and Government officers.


iii) Enhance efficiency in processing of
bills/claims.


iv) Reduce discretion in processing of bills
through “First-In-First-Out” (FIFO)
method.


**d)** Currently, the suppliers of various goods
and services to the Government have to

submit physical, ink signed copies of their
bills to the respective Ministries/
Departments /Offices of the Government of
India. Similarly, the government employees



also need to submit hard copies of their
claims. At the backend too, the processing of
bills is done through a mixed system of
physical and digital modes. So, the
suppliers/vendors or their representatives
need to visit the offices to deliver bills.

Moreover, they are able to track the status of
processing of their bills.


**e)** Under the newly launched e-Bill system,
vendors/suppliers can upload their bills
online along with supporting documents
from the convenience of their homes/
offices at any time through digital signature.
For those not having a digital signature, the
facility of e-sign using Aadhaar has also
been provided. So, the suppliers will no
longer be required to visit the offices
concerned for this purpose.


**f)** At the backend too, the electronic bill
received will be processed by the authorities
digitally at every stage and finally, the
payments will be credited digitally to the
bank account of the vendor. The vendor/
supplier would be able to track the status of
processing of their bills online. Thus, the
new system will bring in lot of efficiency and
transparency in the system and is a big
citizen-centric decision of the Government

of India.


**g)** The e-bill system has been developed by the
Public Financial Management System
(PFMS) Division in the office of the
