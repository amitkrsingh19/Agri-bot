       "\"\\nAgriculture and Allied Sectors\\nCrop wise Analysis\\nRice\\nRice is the most important food crop grown in Kerala. It occupies 7.46 percent of the total cropped area of the state. However, the area under rice has been falling at an alarming rate ever since the 1980s. From 8.82 lakh hectare in 1974-75, the paddy area has come down to 1.96 lakh hectare in 2015-16. The production has also concomitantly declined from 13.76 lakh MT in 1972-73 (peak of production) to 5.49 lakh MT in 2015-16 (Appendix 2.4). Moreover, the productivity of the crop is very low in the State (2790 kg/ha), though it is higher than the national average (2424 kg/ha). There has only been a marginal increase in the productivity of rice in the past four decades. China, which is the major producer of rice in the world, reports a productivity (6744 kg/ha) more than three times the productivity of rice in Kerala. The productivity of rice in Egypt is the highest in the world (9088 kg/ha), which is nearly four-fold of our productivity. Punjab is the state with the highest yield in the country (3952 kg/ha). In the recent months, the State government has taken a number of steps for the promotion of paddy cultivation.\\n\\nMajor initiatives for the promotion of rice in 2016-17 \\n\\nPromotion of upland rice cultivation in 2520 ha\\nAmendment in Paddy land/Wetland Conservation Act\\nCultivation in fallow lands\\nSpecial projects in Aranmula Punja\\n Declaring Chingam 1st of 2016 to Chingam 1st of 2017 as the rice year in which 100 activities are planned\\nEnhancement of procurement price of paddy from 21.50/Kg to 22.50/Kg\\n\\n Source: Agriculture Department\\nThere are three main rice growing seasons in the state: (a) Virippu season/Autumn season/First crop season, which starts in April-May and extends up to September-October; (b) Mundakan season/Winter season/Second crop season, which starts in September-October and extends up to December-January; and (c) Puncha season/Summer season/Third crop season, which starts in December-January and extends up to March-April. In Kerala, winter crop (mundakan) has been greater than the other two crops (summer and autumn) both in terms of area as well as production. However, in 2015-16, all the three seasons showed a declining trend resulting in an overall reduction in production(Appendix 2.5). \\nPalakkad, Alappuzha, Thrissur and Kottayam account for about 81.2 percent of the total production of rice in the state, their individual shares being 41 percent, 16 percent, 14 percent and 9 percent respectively. In 2015-16, Alappuzha and Palakkad recorded a decline in production, while Thrissur and Kottayam recorded a slight increase in production. District-wise area under rice cultivation shows that area under rice fell for all the districts of the State between 1996-97 and 2012-13. However, the decline was sharpest for Ernakulam (93 per cent) followed by Kollam (92 per cent), Thiruvananthapuram (86 per cent) and Malappuram (78 per cent). On the positive side, in Kottayam and Alappuzha, the major rice growing districts, the decline was much less pronounced (13 and 12 per cent respectively). In 2015-16, Palakkad, Alappuzha and Wayanad, showed a decline in area as well as production of rice in the State (Details as given in Appendix 2.6 and Appendix 2.7 and Figure 2.4).\\r\\n\\xa0\\nFigure 2.4\\r\\n              Percentage change in area and production of rice in major districts \\r\\n              of Kerala during 2015-16 over 2014-15, in per cent\\n\\n Source: Directorate of Economics and Statistics, Govt. of Kerala\\nArea cultivated with paddy has increasingly been converted into cultivation with other crops as well as for non-agricultural purposes. This is mainly due to the low relative profitability in paddy cultivation, which in turn is a result of increasing costs due to rising wages and relative price changes in favour of competing crops. In spite of focused interventions through the State plan and programmes like Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY), enhancement of per hectare assistance from 1500 to 4500 in the 12th plan period and the introduction of procurement in all districts, rice production has not responded positively. More proactive steps under the leadership of the Department of Agriculture and local bodies are required to revitalise rice production in the State.\\nCoconut\\nIn terms of area under cultivation, coconut is the most important crop in the state with over 7.9 lakh hectare under cultivation. It accounts for the largest share in the Gross Cropped Area (GCA) followed by rubber and paddy. Kerala has the largest area under the crop in the country, but in terms of production it comes third. This indicates the low productivity of the crop in the state with just 7535 nuts per hectare compared to Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh where the productivity is 14,873 nuts per hectare and 13,808 nuts per hectare respectively in 2014-15. Also, Keralaâ€™s share in area and production of coconut in the country has declined over time. While Kerala accounted for 69.58 per cent of the area and 69.52 per cent of the production in the country in 1960-61, the corresponding shares declined to 40.2 per cent and 42.12 per cent respectively in 2011-12. However, the area and production of coconut in the state has been increasing. From 29.88 per cent of the Net Sown Area in 1980-81, the share of area cultivated with coconut increased to 41.96 per cent in 2000-01; in 2011-12, the corresponding share stood at 40.24 per cent. The production also increased during this period. From 3220 million nuts in 1960-61, the production increased to 5536 million nuts in 2000-01. After that the production plateaued and was more or less stagnant in the next decade. Thus, the increase in output was more on account of increase in acreage as the productivity of the crop is very low in the state. Between 2014-15 and 2015-16, there was a marginal decline in the production of coconut from 5947 million nuts to 5873 million nuts. Area, production and productivity of coconut in Kerala are given in Appendix 2.8\\nThe main reason for the falling productivity of coconut is the prevalence of the root wilt disease, poor crop management and the existence of senile and unproductive palms. Hence, massive replanting of palms affected by root wilt with elite palms and elimination of senile palms, setting up of nurseries for production of quality seedlings and their subsequent distribution is essential for increasing productivity. Restructuring of the cluster development programme is also essential for more effectiveness. The attempt made by the Department of Agriculture and Cooperation to restructure two coconut development programmes through convergence approach at the panchayat level, coupled with a price advantage, is expected to revive coconut production in the state. The isolated attempts at the production of dwarf coconut seedlings and hybrids need to be scaled up substantially with the support of research institutions. Entrepreneurial ventures for the production of value-added products like desiccated coconut, beverages, shell-based products, coconut cream, and neera have to be promoted with appropriate tie-ups with credit and marketing agencies. The coconut procurement system through Krishi Bhavans in association with Kerafed was introduced in 2012-13, which needs further streamlining. The initiative taken by the government in promoting neera and value addition are expected to revive coconut economy of the state.\\nPepper\\nIndia comes third in the production of pepper in the world after Vietnam and Indonesia. However, the production of pepper in the country has been stagnant at around 50,000 tonnes in the last few years and hence is fast losing its status as a leading producer and exporter of pepper. Grown mostly in the slopes of Western Ghats in Kerala, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu, the area under cultivation of pepper has come down drastically in the last decade, which has adversely affected production and export. In 2015-16, pepper production recorded a decline to 55,000 tonnes from 70,000 tonnes in 2014-15. However, Kerala, which accounts for 75 percent of the total production in the country, recorded a slight increase in pepper production from 40.6 thousand tonnes in 2014-15 to 42.1 thousand tonnes in 2015-16. \\nWith regard to prices, there has been a rally in pepper prices since 2010. However, in 2015, the prices registered a decline to 630.31 per kg from 646.79 per kg in 2014. The price realization during 2016 (January-June) was 669.29 per kg compared to 619.76 per kg in June 2015, an increase of  49.53 per kg.\\xa0\\nPepper production in the State in recent years has been affected mainly by low productivity and various diseases. In order to revive spices development in the state, the Department of Agriculture had initiated comprehensive pepper development programmes in all districts in 2014-15. An integrated action plan was prepared for the revival of the crop, covering reorientation of planting material production, expansion of grafting wherever possible, area-wide disease management, liming and nutrients management and revival of pepper samities. The increase in production achieved during 2015-16 could be because of this concerted effort by the State Government.\\nCashew\\nIn 2015-16, India continued to be the largest producer of raw cashew nuts in the world. The other main producing countries were Vietnam, Brazil, Tanzania and Ivory Coast. The production of raw cashew nuts in India declined from 725 thousand MT in 2014-15 to 670 thousand MT in 2015-16. The area under cashew cultivation, however, recorded an increase from 1027 thousand hectares to 1034 thousand hectares.\\nIn Kerala, in the last one decade, there has been a continuous and considerable decline in both area under cultivation as well as production of cashew. It is alarming to note that the production, which stood at 60 thousand MT in 2004-05, declined to 33.3 thousand MT in 2013-14 and to 24.73 thousand MT in 2015-16. The area under cultivation dwindled from 81,000 hectares to 49,000 hectares and to 43,000 hectares during the same period. The productivity of cashew, which was around 900 kg per hectare during the late eighties, also fell to 654 kg per hectare in 2014-15. Details are given in Appendix 2.9\\nArea under and production of cashew have risen steadily in other producing states of the country. Even though Andhra Pradesh has the highest area under cultivation (18.3 per cent), Maharashtra is the leading producer with 32.9 percent share in production during 2013-14.\\nPlantation crops\\nPlantation crops are, in general, either export-oriented or import-substituting and therefore assume special significance from the national point of view. It is estimated that nearly 14 lakh families are dependent on the plantation sector for livelihood. Each of the four plantation crops of South India has its distinct characteristics and economic problems. Consequent to the removal of quantitative restrictions on imports, plantation crops are facing the threat of a surge in low quality imports.\\nKerala has a substantial share in the area in India cultivated with the four plantation crops of rubber, tea, coffee and cardamom. These four crops together occupy 7.04 lakh ha, accounting for 26.88 percent of the gross cropped area in the state. During 2013-14, Keralaâ€™s share in the national production was 72.02 per cent in rubber, 22 per cent in coffee and 6.3 percent in tea. Details are given in Appendix 2.10\\nRubber\\nProduction of Natural Rubber (NR) in India declined by 12.9 per cent from 6.45 lakh tones in 2014-15 to 5.62 lakh tonnes in 2015-16. Even though tappable area under natural rubber was 5.59 lakh ha during 2015-16, only 3.91 lakh ha of area contributed to the NR production during the year. Consequently, the average yield, measured in terms of production per hectare of tapped area, declined to 1437 kg/ha in 2015-16 as compared to 1443 kg/ha the previous year. During 2016-17, the production is estimated to be 6.54 lakh tonnes of NR. Adverse weather, high wages, lack of skilled labourers and the growerâ€™s reluctance in harvesting or maintaining trees in response to the low NR prices have affected the production of natural rubber (NR) in India in 2016. The consumption of NR in the country also came down by 2.6 percent to 10.2 lakh tonnes in 2014-15. This was due to a 2.5 percent decline in auto tyre manufacturing and a 2.7 percent fall in the general rubber goods production. The volume of exports came down to 865 tonnes in 2015-16 from 1002 tonnes in 2014-15. The Central Government continued to provide incentives for exporting qualityâ€“endorsed branded Indian Natural Rubber under a Marketâ€“linked Focus Product Scheme. The production scene was no different in Kerala also, as the total production dwindled from 5.07 lakh MT in 2014-15 to 4.38 lakh MT in 2015-16. \\nWith regard to rubber prices, it has been volatile in both the national and international markets. NR prices after scaling to an all-time high during 2011 had fallen significantly, that too at an accelerating pace threatening the very existence of the rubber producers. Rubber prices , both in the domestic and international markets had been moving in tandem throughout the year. Domestic RRSS-4 and international RSS-3 prices increased from April 2015 to June 2015 and then started decreasing from July 2015 to February 2016 and started slow recovery during the end of the year. Main reasons for the fall in rubber prices were moderate economic growth in China, slow recovery in the US and Europe, enhanced stock in Thailand, increase in world stock of NR, relatively low oil prices and consequent low synthetic rubber prices. The domestic RSS-4 price at Kottayam market came down and averaged at 113.06 per kg during 2015-16 compared to 132.57 per kg during the previous year. Domestic RSS4 price peaked at 133 per kg on 17.06.2015 and international price of RSS-3 peaked at 122 per kg on 03.06.2015. Domestic RSS-4 prices was ruling above the international RSS-3 price throughout the year during 2015-16. Details are given in Appendix 2.11, Appendix 2.12 and Appendix 2.13\\nThe declining rubber production in the year has affected Indiaâ€™s ranking internationally as it has been pushed to the fifth position with countries like Vietnam and China occupying the third and fourth position respectively. Thailand continues to be the top producer followed by Indonesia in the second spot in the global rubber scene. \\nThe declining price of rubber is a cause of concern. A revival of rubber prices is expected based on the revision of import duty and other measures taken by Government of India. However, more proactive measures by the central government are essential to support the rubber growers of Kerala. The strengthening and reorientation of Price Stabilisation Fund is essential. The Government of Kerala has introduced a rubber production incentive scheme with a financial support of Rs 300 crores. However, to a large extent the price depends on global supply and demand of natural rubber and the price of synthetic rubber. \\nCoffee\\nDomestic coffee production for the year 2015-16 was estimated at 348,000 tonnes, which represents an increase of 21,000 tonnes compared to previous year. Initially, the Coffee Board had projected 2015-16 crop production (Post Blossom estimate) at 355,000 tonnes, which was subsequently revised downwards by  7,000 tonnes. As per the revised figure, the Arabica production was estimated at 103.5 thousand tonnes (29.7 per cent) and Robusta at 244.5 thousand tonnes (70.3 per cent). However, as per FAO estimates, yield in India at 845.6 kg per hectare is much below that of Vietnam (2499.1 kg per hectare) and Brazil (1421.5 kg per hectare). A comparison of the productivity levels in 1971 vis-a-vis 2011 suggests that India (-1.8 per cent) and Indonesia (-0.1 per cent) are the only two countries that reported a decline in yield levels in the last 40 years. Lower productivity in India is due to limited mechanization, pest infestation, existence of old/senile plants and labour shortage. Thus, on the productivity side, much more is needed to be done and towards this concerted efforts are required both at the policy and farm level. The only way to address this issue is by providing positive research and development which can directly contribute in achieving higher yield.\\nWith regard to Kerala, the production of coffee registered a slight increase from 67,700 MT in 2014-15 to 69,230 MT in 2015-16. The share of Kerala in total coffee production in the country is around 20 per cent during the year. Major variety grown in Kerala is Robusta with a share of 97.1 per cent in planted area. Productivity of the crop in terms of bearing area in Kerala is 808 kg/ha, which is lower than the national level of 852 kg/ha during 2011-12. Among the States, Kerala stands next to Karnataka which produces 70.4 percent of total Indian coffee production. \\nTea\\nAs one of the largest tea producing countries, India accounts for 24.8 percent of the total world production. The Tea Board had revised the production figures during 2011 by bringing within the net all segments of tea producers, both organized and unorganized, especially North India many of whom were not reporting their crop statistics earlier, which helped India in breaching the 1 billion mark. The domestic tea production during 2015 was 1191.1mkg lower by 16.2 mkg from previous year. The decline in production in North India and South India was 1.6 mkg and 14.6 mkg respectively. The steep fall in production in south India after a one year reprieve from the low crop trap is a matter of concern. \\nKerala accounts for 5.03 per cent of the area and 6.3 percent of the total domestic production of tea in the country. The production of tea in the State has been consistently falling since 2009-10. There was a slight improvement in 2012-13 as tea production recorded an increase of 5059 MT despite a decline in area of 18 per cent. This increase in production was mainly on account of increase in productivity. Tea production recorded an increase of 3.5 per cent in 2014-15 also but in 2015-16 there was a decline in production by 11.16 percent. Details given in Appendix 2.14\\nThe major issues affecting the tea industry are stagnant productivity, acute labour shortage, high cost of machines, and lack of indigenous machinery.\\nCardamom\\nIndia is the second largest producer of small cardamom and plays an important role in the international trade of cardamom. The output of cardamom is dependent on prevailing climatic conditions as the cardamom plant requires intermittent spells of rains and good sunshine during the growth stage. Cardamom production in the country during 2015-16 was estimated at 22 thousand tonnes compared to 18 thousand tonnes in 2014-15, an increase of 4 thousand tonnes. The turnaround in cardamom prices since 2006-07 continued up to 2010-11 reaching the highest level, but thereafter the prices have fluctuated. During 2015-16 (August-June), the prices increased by  107.33 per kg to reach 754.00 per kg. \\nMeanwhile in Kerala, cardamom production has increased by 21.8 per cent in 2015-16 despite the area under cultivation remaining stagnant. \\nPulses\\nThe year 2016 was the International Year of Pulses. Pulses are important source of protein, high in fibre content and provide ample quantity of vitamins and minerals. Keeping in view large benefits of pulses for human health, the United Nations proclaimed 2016 as the International Year of Pulses. Thus, due attention is required to enhance the production of pulses not only to meet the dietary requirement of protein but also to raise the awareness about pulses for achieving nutritional, food security and environmental sustainability. Pulses are important component to sustain the agriculture production as the crops posses wide adaptability to fit into various cropping systems and improves the soil fertility.\\nIndia's share is 25 per cent in production, about 33 per cent in acreage and \\r\\n              about 27 per cent in consumption of the total pulses in the world. \\r\\n              The acreage ranged from 20.35 million ha (2000-01) to 23.99 million \\r\\n              ha (2012-13) and production varied from 11.08 million tonnes (2000-01) \\r\\n              to 18.45 million tonnes (2012-13). The productivity has increased \\r\\n              from 544 kg/ha (2000-01) to 750 kg/ha (2012-13). The major pulses \\r\\n              producing states are Madhya Pradesh (25 per cent), Uttar Pradesh \\r\\n              (13 per cent), Maharashtra (12 per cent), Rajasthan (11 per cent), \\r\\n              Andhra Pradesh (9 per cent) and other states together (30 per cent) \\r\\n              during 2012-13.\\nIn Kerala, pulses are cultivated in autumn, winter and summer seasons. The area under the cultivation of pulses shows a declining trend in the state. During 1975-76, the total area under pulses including tur was 37,485 ha but by 2015-16 it has come down to 3764 ha. Apart from tur, the other main pulses grown in Kerala are cow pea, black gram horse gram and green gram. Major cultivation of pulses and tur is in Palakkad district and contributes to 30 per cent of the total production in the State. The production of pulses in the State was highest during the year 2005-06. More proactive steps are needed to augment pulse production in the State. Details pertaining to the  sector is given in Appendix 2.15 and Appendix 2.16\\nCollective farming through Kudumbashree\\nCollective farming is an important area of Kudumbasree, which aims at food security both at household and community level. The major crops cultivated are paddy, vegetables, banana, pineapple and tubers. In 2013-14, area brought under cultivation of paddy was 15078.60 ha, of vegetables was 12555.60 ha and of other crops (banana, pineapple and tubers) was 22476.20 ha. Details of area covered are given in Appendix 2.17. More hand holding including facilitation with banks and technology support are essential for improving livelihood of the women groups involved in farming.\\nKey initiatives of the Department of Agriculture\\nThe annual plan schemes for 2016-17 were formulated focusing on the thrust \\r\\n              areas and strategies for increasing the productivity in agriculture \\r\\n              from the current levels. The key initiatives taken by the Department \\r\\n              of Agriculture in 2016-17 for the improvement of agricultural sector \\r\\n              included integrated food crop production programme focusing on self- \\r\\n              sufficiency in vegetable production including comprehensive rice \\r\\n              development, modernization of existing farms and labs and establishment \\r\\n              of new labs, institutional mechanism for marketing, focusing initially \\r\\n              on vegetables development of farmers markets and setting up of agriculture \\r\\n              markets, production and distribution of quality planting materials, \\r\\n              comprehensive fallow land cultivation with people's participation, \\r\\n              strengthening extension activities, Agricultural Technology Management \\r\\n              Agency (ATMA) plus model of extension, rejuvenation of spices economy, \\r\\n              crop health management covering pests and disease surveillance, \\r\\n              promotion of organic farming and safe food production, crop insurance, \\r\\n              establishment of 20 Agro Service Centres (ASCs) and strengthening \\r\\n              the existing ASCs for improved service delivery, revival package \\r\\n              for pepper in Wayanad. In 2016-17, the Harithakeralam Mission has \\r\\n              been launched focusing on food crop production, waste management \\r\\n              and water resource conservation and development.\\nPerformance of Annual Plan, 2015-16 of Department of Agriculture\\nDuring the Annual Plan 2015-16, out of 474.93 crore earmarked \\r\\n              for the Department of Agriculture under the state plan, the expenditure \\r\\n              incurred was 449.14 crore (95 per cent) including Wayanad package. \\r\\n              The key achievements of the Department of Agriculture in 2015-16 \\r\\n              were the following.\\n\\nFor rice development, assistance was given to padasekhara samithies  for sustaining rice cultivation in 1.79 lakh ha through group farming  and for speciality rice cultivation in 890 ha.\\n For coconut development, the Department established 10 coconut  nurseries and 474 organic manure production units, supported 26   Keragramams covering 12.300ha, distributed 2600 climbing devices \\r\\n              and installed irrigation units in 656ha.

It occupies 7.46 percent of the total cropped area of the state. However, the area under rice has been falling at an alarming rate ever since the 1980s. From 8.82 lakh hectare in 1974-75, the paddy area has come down to 1.96 lakh hectare in 2015-16. The production has also concomitantly declined from 13.76 lakh MT in 1972-73 (peak of production) to 5.49 lakh MT in 2015-16 (Appendix 2.4). Moreover, the productivity of the crop is very low in the State (2790 kg/ha), though it is higher than the national average (2424 kg/ha). There has only been a marginal increase in the productivity of rice in the past four decades. China, which is the major producer of rice in the world, reports a productivity (6744 kg/ha) more than three times the productivity of rice in Kerala. The productivity of rice in Egypt is the highest in the world (9088 kg/ha), which is nearly four-fold of our productivity. Punjab is the state with the highest yield in the country (3952 kg/ha). In the recent months, the State government has taken a number of steps for the promotion of paddy cultivation.\\n\\nMajor initiatives for the promotion of rice in 2016-17 \\n\\nPromotion of upland rice cultivation in 2520 ha\\nAmendment in Paddy land/Wetland Conservation Act\\nCultivation in fallow lands\\nSpecial projects in Aranmula Punja\\n Declaring Chingam 1st of 2016 to Chingam 1st of 2017 as the rice year in which 100 activities are planned\\nEnhancement of procurement price of paddy from 21.50/Kg to 22.50/Kg\\n\\n Source: Agriculture Department\\nThere are three main rice growing seasons in the state: (a) Virippu season/Autumn season/First crop season, which starts in April-May and extends up to September-October; (b) Mundakan season/Winter season/Second crop season, which starts in September-October and extends up to December-January; and (c) Puncha season/Summer season/Third crop season, which starts in December-January and extends up to March-April. In Kerala, winter crop (mundakan) has been greater than the other two crops (summer and autumn) both in terms of area as well as production. However, in 2015-16, all the three seasons showed a declining trend resulting in an overall reduction in production(Appendix 2.5). \\nPalakkad, Alappuzha, Thrissur and Kottayam account for about 81.2 percent of the total production of rice in the state, their individual shares being 41 percent, 16 percent, 14 percent and 9 percent respectively. In 2015-16, Alappuzha and Palakkad recorded a decline in production, while Thrissur and Kottayam recorded a slight increase in production. District-wise area under rice cultivation shows that area under rice fell for all the districts of the State between 1996-97 and 2012-13. However, the decline was sharpest for Ernakulam (93 per cent) followed by Kollam (92 per cent), Thiruvananthapuram (86 per cent) and Malappuram (78 per cent). On the positive side, in Kottayam and Alappuzha, the major rice growing districts, the decline was much less pronounced (13 and 12 per cent respectively). In 2015-16, Palakkad, Alappuzha and Wayanad, showed a decline in area as well as production of rice in the State (Details as given in Appendix 2.6 and Appendix 2.7 and Figure 2.4).\\r\\n\\xa0\\nFigure 2.4\\r\\n              Percentage change in area and production of rice in major districts \\r\\n              of Kerala during 2015-16 over 2014-15, in per cent'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'https://spb.kerala.gov.in/economic-review/ER2016/chapter02_03.php', 'start_index': 3454}, page_content='Source: Directorate of Economics and Statistics, Govt. of Kerala\\nArea cultivated with paddy has increasingly been converted into cultivation with other crops as well as for non-agricultural purposes. This is mainly due to the low relative profitability in paddy cultivation, which in turn is a result of increasing costs due to rising wages and relative price changes in favour of competing crops. In spite of focused interventions through the State plan and programmes like Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY), enhancement of per hectare assistance from 1500 to 4500 in the 12th plan period and the introduction of procurement in all districts, rice production has not responded positively. More proactive steps under the leadership of the Department of Agriculture and local bodies are required to revitalise rice production in the State.\\nCoconut\\nIn terms of area under cultivation, coconut is the most important crop in the state with over 7.9 lakh hectare under cultivation. It accounts for the largest share in the Gross Cropped Area (GCA) followed by rubber and paddy. Kerala has the largest area under the crop in the country, but in terms of production it comes third. This indicates the low productivity of the crop in the state with just 7535 nuts per hectare compared to Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh where the productivity is 14,873 nuts per hectare and 13,808 nuts per hectare respectively in 2014-15. Also, Keralaâ€™s share in area and production of coconut in the country has declined over time. While Kerala accounted for 69.58 per cent of the area and 69.52 per cent of the production in the country in 1960-61, the corresponding shares declined to 40.2 per cent and 42.12 per cent respectively in 2011-12. However, the area and production of coconut in the state has been increasing. From 29.88 per cent of the Net Sown Area in 1980-81, the share of area cultivated with coconut increased to 41.96 per cent in 2000-01; in 2011-12, the corresponding share stood at 40.24 per cent. The production also increased during this period. From 3220 million nuts in 1960-61, the production increased to 5536 million nuts in 2000-01. After that the production plateaued and was more or less stagnant in the next decade. Thus, the increase in output was more on account of increase in acreage as the productivity of the crop is very low in the state. Between 2014-15 and 2015-16, there was a marginal decline in the production of coconut from 5947 million nuts to 5873 million nuts. Area, production and productivity of coconut in Kerala are given in Appendix 2.8\\nThe main reason for the falling productivity of coconut is the prevalence of the root wilt disease, poor crop management and the existence of senile and unproductive palms. Hence, massive replanting of palms affected by root wilt with elite palms and elimination of senile palms, setting up of nurseries for production of quality seedlings and their subsequent distribution is essential for increasing productivity. Restructuring of the cluster development programme is also essential for more effectiveness. The attempt made by the Department of Agriculture and Cooperation to restructure two coconut development programmes through convergence approach at the panchayat level, coupled with a price advantage, is expected to revive coconut production in the state. The isolated attempts at the production of dwarf coconut seedlings and hybrids need to be scaled up substantially with the support of research institutions. Entrepreneurial ventures for the production of value-added products like desiccated coconut, beverages, shell-based products, coconut cream, and neera have to be promoted with appropriate tie-ups with credit and marketing agencies. The coconut procurement system through Krishi Bhavans in association with Kerafed was introduced in 2012-13, which needs further streamlining. The initiative taken by the government in promoting neera and value addition are expected to revive coconut economy of the state.\\nPepper\\nIndia comes third in the production of pepper in the world after Vietnam and Indonesia. However, the production of pepper in the country has been stagnant at around 50,000 tonnes in the last few years and hence is fast losing its status as a leading producer and exporter of pepper. Grown mostly in the slopes of Western Ghats in Kerala, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu, the area under cultivation of pepper has come down drastically in the last decade, which has adversely affected production and export. In 2015-16, pepper production recorded a decline to 55,000 tonnes from 70,000 tonnes in 2014-15. However, Kerala, which accounts for 75 percent of the total production in the country, recorded a slight increase in pepper production from 40.6 thousand tonnes in 2014-15 to 42.1 thousand tonnes in 2015-16. \\nWith regard to prices, there has been a rally in pepper prices since 2010. However, in 2015, the prices registered a decline to 630.31 per kg from 646.79 per kg in 2014. The price realization during 2016 (January-June) was 669.29 per kg compared to 619.76 per kg in June 2015, an increase of  49.53 per kg.\\xa0\\nPepper production in the State in recent years has been affected mainly by low productivity and various diseases. In order to revive spices development in the state, the Department of Agriculture had initiated comprehensive pepper development programmes in all districts in 2014-15. An integrated action plan was prepared for the revival of the crop, covering reorientation of planting material production, expansion of grafting wherever possible, area-wide disease management, liming and nutrients management and revival of pepper samities. The increase in production achieved during 2015-16 could be because of this concerted effort by the State Government.\\nCashew'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'https://spb.kerala.gov.in/economic-review/ER2016/chapter02_03.php', 'start_index': 9231}, page_content='Cashew\\nIn 2015-16, India continued to be the largest producer of raw cashew nuts in the world. The other main producing countries were Vietnam, Brazil, Tanzania and Ivory Coast. The production of raw cashew nuts in India declined from 725 thousand MT in 2014-15 to 670 thousand MT in 2015-16. The area under cashew cultivation, however, recorded an increase from 1027 thousand hectares to 1034 thousand hectares.\\nIn Kerala, in the last one decade, there has been a continuous and considerable decline in both area under cultivation as well as production of cashew. It is alarming to note that the production, which stood at 60 thousand MT in 2004-05, declined to 33.3 thousand MT in 2013-14 and to 24.73 thousand MT in 2015-16. The area under cultivation dwindled from 81,000 hectares to 49,000 hectares and to 43,000 hectares during the same period. The productivity of cashew, which was around 900 kg per hectare during the late eighties, also fell to 654 kg per hectare in 2014-15. Details are given in Appendix 2.9\\nArea under and production of cashew have risen steadily in other producing states of the country. Even though Andhra Pradesh has the highest area under cultivation (18.3 per cent), Maharashtra is the leading producer with 32.9 percent share in production during 2013-14.\\nPlantation crops\\nPlantation crops are, in general, either export-oriented or import-substituting and therefore assume special significance from the national point of view. It is estimated that nearly 14 lakh families are dependent on the plantation sector for livelihood. Each of the four plantation crops of South India has its distinct characteristics and economic problems. Consequent to the removal of quantitative restrictions on imports, plantation crops are facing the threat of a surge in low quality imports.\\nKerala has a substantial share in the area in India cultivated with the four plantation crops of rubber, tea, coffee and cardamom. These four crops together occupy 7.04 lakh ha, accounting for 26.88 percent of the gross cropped area in the state. During 2013-14, Keralaâ€™s share in the national production was 72.02 per cent in rubber, 22 per cent in coffee and 6.3 percent in tea. Details are given in Appendix 2.10\\nRubber\\nProduction of Natural Rubber (NR) in India declined by 12.9 per cent from 6.45 lakh tones in 2014-15 to 5.62 lakh tonnes in 2015-16. Even though tappable area under natural rubber was 5.59 lakh ha during 2015-16, only 3.91 lakh ha of area contributed to the NR production during the year. Consequently, the average yield, measured in terms of production per hectare of tapped area, declined to 1437 kg/ha in 2015-16 as compared to 1443 kg/ha the previous year. During 2016-17, the production is estimated to be 6.54 lakh tonnes of NR. Adverse weather, high wages, lack of skilled labourers and the growerâ€™s reluctance in harvesting or maintaining trees in response to the low NR prices have affected the production of natural rubber (NR) in India in 2016. The consumption of NR in the country also came down by 2.6 percent to 10.2 lakh tonnes in 2014-15. This was due to a 2.5 percent decline in auto tyre manufacturing and a 2.7 percent fall in the general rubber goods production. The volume of exports came down to 865 tonnes in 2015-16 from 1002 tonnes in 2014-15. The Central Government continued to provide incentives for exporting qualityâ€“endorsed branded Indian Natural Rubber under a Marketâ€“linked Focus Product Scheme. The production scene was no different in Kerala also, as the total production dwindled from 5.07 lakh MT in 2014-15 to 4.38 lakh MT in 2015-16. \\nWith regard to rubber prices, it has been volatile in both the national and international markets. NR prices after scaling to an all-time high during 2011 had fallen significantly, that too at an accelerating pace threatening the very existence of the rubber producers. Rubber prices , both in the domestic and international markets had been moving in tandem throughout the year. Domestic RRSS-4 and international RSS-3 prices increased from April 2015 to June 2015 and then started decreasing from July 2015 to February 2016 and started slow recovery during the end of the year. Main reasons for the fall in rubber prices were moderate economic growth in China, slow recovery in the US and Europe, enhanced stock in Thailand, increase in world stock of NR, relatively low oil prices and consequent low synthetic rubber prices. The domestic RSS-4 price at Kottayam market came down and averaged at 113.06 per kg during 2015-16 compared to 132.57 per kg during the previous year. Domestic RSS4 price peaked at 133 per kg on 17.06.2015 and international price of RSS-3 peaked at 122 per kg on 03.06.2015. Domestic RSS-4 prices was ruling above the international RSS-3 price throughout the year during 2015-16. Details are given in Appendix 2.11, Appendix 2.12 and Appendix 2.13\\nThe declining rubber production in the year has affected Indiaâ€™s ranking internationally as it has been pushed to the fifth position with countries like Vietnam and China occupying the third and fourth position respectively. Thailand continues to be the top producer followed by Indonesia in the second spot in the global rubber scene.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'https://spb.kerala.gov.in/economic-review/ER2016/chapter02_03.php', 'start_index': -1}, page_content='The declining rubber production in the year has affected Indiaâ€™s ranking internationally as it has been pushed to the fifth position with countries like Vietnam and China occupying the third and fourth position respectively. Thailand continues to be the top producer followed by Indonesia in the second spot in the global rubber scene. \\nThe declining price of rubber is a cause of concern. A revival of rubber prices is expected based on the revision of import duty and other measures taken by Government of India. However, more proactive measures by the central government are essential to support the rubber growers of Kerala. The strengthening and reorientation of Price Stabilisation Fund is essential. The Government of Kerala has introduced a rubber production incentive scheme with a financial support of Rs 300 crores. However, to a large extent the price depends on global supply and demand of natural rubber and the price of synthetic rubber. \\nCoffee\\nDomestic coffee production for the year 2015-16 was estimated at 348,000 tonnes, which represents an increase of 21,000 tonnes compared to previous year. Initially, the Coffee Board had projected 2015-16 crop production (Post Blossom estimate) at 355,000 tonnes, which was subsequently revised downwards by  7,000 tonnes. As per the revised figure, the Arabica production was estimated at 103.5 thousand tonnes (29.7 per cent) and Robusta at 244.5 thousand tonnes (70.3 per cent). However, as per FAO estimates, yield in India at 845.6 kg per hectare is much below that of Vietnam (2499.1 kg per hectare) and Brazil (1421.5 kg per hectare). A comparison of the productivity levels in 1971 vis-a-vis 2011 suggests that India (-1.8 per cent) and Indonesia (-0.1 per cent) are the only two countries that reported a decline in yield levels in the last 40 years. Lower productivity in India is due to limited mechanization, pest infestation, existence of old/senile plants and labour shortage. Thus, on the productivity side, much more is needed to be done and towards this concerted efforts are required both at the policy and farm level. The only way to address this issue is by providing positive research and development which can directly contribute in achieving higher yield.\\nWith regard to Kerala, the production of coffee registered a slight increase from 67,700 MT in 2014-15 to 69,230 MT in 2015-16. The share of Kerala in total coffee production in the country is around 20 per cent during the year. Major variety grown in Kerala is Robusta with a share of 97.1 per cent in planted area. Productivity of the crop in terms of bearing area in Kerala is 808 kg/ha, which is lower than the national level of 852 kg/ha during 2011-12. Among the States, Kerala stands next to Karnataka which produces 70.4 percent of total Indian coffee production. \\nTea\\nAs one of the largest tea producing countries, India accounts for 24.8 percent of the total world production. The Tea Board had revised the production figures during 2011 by bringing within the net all segments of tea producers, both organized and unorganized, especially North India many of whom were not reporting their crop statistics earlier, which helped India in breaching the 1 billion mark. The domestic tea production during 2015 was 1191.1mkg lower by 16.2 mkg from previous year. The decline in production in North India and South India was 1.6 mkg and 14.6 mkg respectively. The steep fall in production in south India after a one year reprieve from the low crop trap is a matter of concern. \\nKerala accounts for 5.03 per cent of the area and 6.3 percent of the total domestic production of tea in the country. The production of tea in the State has been consistently falling since 2009-10. There was a slight improvement in 2012-13 as tea production recorded an increase of 5059 MT despite a decline in area of 18 per cent. This increase in production was mainly on account of increase in productivity. Tea production recorded an increase of 3.5 per cent in 2014-15 also but in 2015-16 there was a decline in production by 11.16 percent. Details given in Appendix 2.14\\nThe major issues affecting the tea industry are stagnant productivity, acute labour shortage, high cost of machines, and lack of indigenous machinery.\\nCardamom\\nIndia is the second largest producer of small cardamom and plays an important role in the international trade of cardamom. The output of cardamom is dependent on prevailing climatic conditions as the cardamom plant requires intermittent spells of rains and good sunshine during the growth stage. Cardamom production in the country during 2015-16 was estimated at 22 thousand tonnes compared to 18 thousand tonnes in 2014-15, an increase of 4 thousand tonnes. The turnaround in cardamom prices since 2006-07 continued up to 2010-11 reaching the highest level, but thereafter the prices have fluctuated.

Pulses are important source of protein, high in fibre content and provide ample quantity of vitamins and minerals. Keeping in view large benefits of pulses for human health, the United Nations proclaimed 2016 as the International Year of Pulses. Thus, due attention is required to enhance the production of pulses not only to meet the dietary requirement of protein but also to raise the awareness about pulses for achieving nutritional, food security and environmental sustainability. Pulses are important component to sustain the agriculture production as the crops posses wide adaptability to fit into various cropping systems and improves the soil fertility.\\nIndia's share is 25 per cent in production, about 33 per cent in acreage and \\r\\n              about 27 per cent in consumption of the total pulses in the world. \\r\\n              The acreage ranged from 20.35 million ha (2000-01) to 23.99 million \\r\\n              ha (2012-13) and production varied from 11.08 million tonnes (2000-01) \\r\\n              to 18.45 million tonnes (2012-13). The productivity has increased \\r\\n              from 544 kg/ha (2000-01) to 750 kg/ha (2012-13). The major pulses \\r\\n              producing states are Madhya Pradesh (25 per cent), Uttar Pradesh \\r\\n              (13 per cent), Maharashtra (12 per cent), Rajasthan (11 per cent), \\r\\n              Andhra Pradesh (9 per cent) and other states together (30 per cent) \\r\\n              during 2012-13.\\nIn Kerala, pulses are cultivated in autumn, winter and summer seasons. The area under the cultivation of pulses shows a declining trend in the state. During 1975-76, the total area under pulses including tur was 37,485 ha but by 2015-16 it has come down to 3764 ha. Apart from tur, the other main pulses grown in Kerala are cow pea, black gram horse gram and green gram. Major cultivation of pulses and tur is in Palakkad district and contributes to 30 per cent of the total production in the State. The production of pulses in the State was highest during the year 2005-06. More proactive steps are needed to augment pulse production in the State. Details pertaining to the  sector is given in Appendix 2.15 and Appendix 2.16\\nCollective farming through Kudumbashree\\nCollective farming is an important area of Kudumbasree, which aims at food security both at household and community level. The major crops cultivated are paddy, vegetables, banana, pineapple and tubers. In 2013-14, area brought under cultivation of paddy was 15078.60 ha, of vegetables was 12555.60 ha and of other crops (banana, pineapple and tubers) was 22476.20 ha. Details of area covered are given in Appendix 2.17.

This is mainly due to the low relative profitability in paddy cultivation, which in turn is a result of increasing costs due to rising wages and relative price changes in favour of competing crops. In spite of focused interventions through the State plan and programmes like Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY), enhancement of per hectare assistance from 1500 to 4500 in the 12th plan period and the introduction of procurement in all districts, rice production has not responded positively. More proactive steps under the leadership of the Department of Agriculture and local bodies are required to revitalise rice production in the State.\\nCoconut\\nIn terms of area under cultivation, coconut is the most important crop in the state with over 7.9 lakh hectare under cultivation. It accounts for the largest share in the Gross Cropped Area (GCA) followed by rubber and paddy. Kerala has the largest area under the crop in the country, but in terms of production it comes third. This indicates the low productivity of the crop in the state with just 7535 nuts per hectare compared to Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh where the productivity is 14,873 nuts per hectare and 13,808 nuts per hectare respectively in 2014-15. Also, Keralaâ€™s share in area and production of coconut in the country has declined over time. While Kerala accounted for 69.58 per cent of the area and 69.52 per cent of the production in the country in 1960-61, the corresponding shares declined to 40.2 per cent and 42.12 per cent respectively in 2011-12. However, the area and production of coconut in the state has been increasing. From 29.88 per cent of the Net Sown Area in 1980-81, the share of area cultivated with coconut increased to 41.96 per cent in 2000-01; in 2011-12, the corresponding share stood at 40.24 per cent. The production also increased during this period. From 3220 million nuts in 1960-61, the production increased to 5536 million nuts in 2000-01. After that the production plateaued and was more or less stagnant in the next decade. Thus, the increase in output was more on account of increase in acreage as the productivity of the crop is very low in the state. Between 2014-15 and 2015-16, there was a marginal decline in the production of coconut from 5947 million nuts to 5873 million nuts. Area, production and productivity of coconut in Kerala are given in Appendix 2.8\\nThe main reason for the falling productivity of coconut is the prevalence of the root wilt disease, poor crop management and the existence of senile and unproductive palms. Hence, massive replanting of palms affected by root wilt with elite palms and elimination of senile palms, setting up of nurseries for production of quality seedlings and their subsequent distribution is essential for increasing productivity. Restructuring of the cluster development programme is also essential for more effectiveness. The attempt made by the Department of Agriculture and Cooperation to restructure two coconut development programmes through convergence approach at the panchayat level, coupled with a price advantage, is expected to revive coconut production in the state. The isolated attempts at the production of dwarf coconut seedlings and hybrids need to be scaled up substantially with the support of research institutions. Entrepreneurial ventures for the production of value-added products like desiccated coconut, beverages, shell-based products, coconut cream, and neera have to be promoted with appropriate tie-ups with credit and marketing agencies. The coconut procurement system through Krishi Bhavans in association with Kerafed was introduced in 2012-13, which needs further streamlining. The initiative taken by the government in promoting neera and value addition are expected to revive coconut economy of the state.\\nPepper\\nIndia comes third in the production of pepper in the world after Vietnam and Indonesia. However, the production of pepper in the country has been stagnant at around 50,000 tonnes in the last few years and hence is fast losing its status as a leading producer and exporter of pepper. Grown mostly in the slopes of Western Ghats in Kerala, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu, the area under cultivation of pepper has come down drastically in the last decade, which has adversely affected production and export. In 2015-16, pepper production recorded a decline to 55,000 tonnes from 70,000 tonnes in 2014-15. However, Kerala, which accounts for 75 percent of the total production in the country, recorded a slight increase in pepper production from 40.6 thousand tonnes in 2014-15 to 42.1 thousand tonnes in 2015-16. \\nWith regard to prices, there has been a rally in pepper prices since 2010. However, in 2015, the prices registered a decline to 630.31 per kg from 646.79 per kg in 2014. The price realization during 2016 (January-June) was 669.29 per kg compared to 619.76 per kg in June 2015, an increase of  49.53 per kg.\\xa0\\nPepper production in the State in recent years has been affected mainly by low productivity and various diseases. In order to revive spices development in the state, the Department of Agriculture had initiated comprehensive pepper development programmes in all districts in 2014-15.

It occupies 7.46 percent of the total cropped area of the state. However, the area under rice has been falling at an alarming rate ever since the 1980s. From 8.82 lakh hectare in 1974-75, the paddy area has come down to 1.96 lakh hectare in 2015-16. The production has also concomitantly declined from 13.76 lakh MT in 1972-73 (peak of production) to 5.49 lakh MT in 2015-16 (Appendix 2.4). Moreover, the productivity of the crop is very low in the State (2790 kg/ha), though it is higher than the national average (2424 kg/ha). There has only been a marginal increase in the productivity of rice in the past four decades. China, which is the major producer of rice in the world, reports a productivity (6744 kg/ha) more than three times the productivity of rice in Kerala. The productivity of rice in Egypt is the highest in the world (9088 kg/ha), which is nearly four-fold of our productivity. Punjab is the state with the highest yield in the country (3952 kg/ha). In the recent months, the State government has taken a number of steps for the promotion of paddy cultivation.\\n\\nMajor initiatives for the promotion of rice in 2016-17 \\n\\nPromotion of upland rice cultivation in 2520 ha\\nAmendment in Paddy land/Wetland Conservation Act\\nCultivation in fallow lands\\nSpecial projects in Aranmula Punja\\n Declaring Chingam 1st of 2016 to Chingam 1st of 2017 as the rice year in which 100 activities are planned\\nEnhancement of procurement price of paddy from 21.50/Kg to 22.50/Kg\\n\\n Source: Agriculture Department\\nThere are three main rice growing seasons in the state: (a) Virippu season/Autumn season/First crop season, which starts in April-May and extends up to September-October; (b) Mundakan season/Winter season/Second crop season, which starts in September-October and extends up to December-January; and (c) Puncha season/Summer season/Third crop season, which starts in December-January and extends up to March-April. In Kerala, winter crop (mundakan) has been greater than the other two crops (summer and autumn) both in terms of area as well as production. However, in 2015-16, all the three seasons showed a declining trend resulting in an overall reduction in production(Appendix 2.5). \\nPalakkad, Alappuzha, Thrissur and Kottayam account for about 81.2 percent of the total production of rice in the state, their individual shares being 41 percent, 16 percent, 14 percent and 9 percent respectively. In 2015-16, Alappuzha and Palakkad recorded a decline in production, while Thrissur and Kottayam recorded a slight increase in production. District-wise area under rice cultivation shows that area under rice fell for all the districts of the State between 1996-97 and 2012-13. However, the decline was sharpest for Ernakulam (93 per cent) followed by Kollam (92 per cent), Thiruvananthapuram (86 per cent) and Malappuram (78 per cent). On the positive side, in Kottayam and Alappuzha, the major rice growing districts, the decline was much less pronounced (13 and 12 per cent respectively). In 2015-16, Palakkad, Alappuzha and Wayanad, showed a decline in area as well as production of rice in the State (Details as given in Appendix 2.6 and Appendix 2.7 and Figure 2.4).\\r\\n\\xa0\\nFigure 2.4\\r\\n              Percentage change in area and production of rice in major districts \\r\\n              of Kerala during 2015-16 over 2014-15, in per cent')]"

This is mainly due to the low relative profitability in paddy cultivation, which in turn is a result of increasing costs due to rising wages and relative price changes in favour of competing crops. In spite of focused interventions through the State plan and programmes like Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY), enhancement of per hectare assistance from 1500 to 4500 in the 12th plan period and the introduction of procurement in all districts, rice production has not responded positively. More proactive steps under the leadership of the Department of Agriculture and local bodies are required to revitalise rice production in the State.\\nCoconut\\nIn terms of area under cultivation, coconut is the most important crop in the state with over 7.9 lakh hectare under cultivation. It accounts for the largest share in the Gross Cropped Area (GCA) followed by rubber and paddy. Kerala has the largest area under the crop in the country, but in terms of production it comes third. This indicates the low productivity of the crop in the state with just 7535 nuts per hectare compared to Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh where the productivity is 14,873 nuts per hectare and 13,808 nuts per hectare respectively in 2014-15. Also, Keralaâ€™s share in area and production of coconut in the country has declined over time. While Kerala accounted for 69.58 per cent of the area and 69.52 per cent of the production in the country in 1960-61, the corresponding shares declined to 40.2 per cent and 42.12 per cent respectively in 2011-12. However, the area and production of coconut in the state has been increasing. From 29.88 per cent of the Net Sown Area in 1980-81, the share of area cultivated with coconut increased to 41.96 per cent in 2000-01; in 2011-12, the corresponding share stood at 40.24 per cent. The production also increased during this period. From 3220 million nuts in 1960-61, the production increased to 5536 million nuts in 2000-01. After that the production plateaued and was more or less stagnant in the next decade. Thus, the increase in output was more on account of increase in acreage as the productivity of the crop is very low in the state. Between 2014-15 and 2015-16, there was a marginal decline in the production of coconut from 5947 million nuts to 5873 million nuts. Area, production and productivity of coconut in Kerala are given in Appendix 2.8\\nThe main reason for the falling productivity of coconut is the prevalence of the root wilt disease, poor crop management and the existence of senile and unproductive palms. Hence, massive replanting of palms affected by root wilt with elite palms and elimination of senile palms, setting up of nurseries for production of quality seedlings and their subsequent distribution is essential for increasing productivity. Restructuring of the cluster development programme is also essential for more effectiveness. The attempt made by the Department of Agriculture and Cooperation to restructure two coconut development programmes through convergence approach at the panchayat level, coupled with a price advantage, is expected to revive coconut production in the state. The isolated attempts at the production of dwarf coconut seedlings and hybrids need to be scaled up substantially with the support of research institutions. Entrepreneurial ventures for the production of value-added products like desiccated coconut, beverages, shell-based products, coconut cream, and neera have to be promoted with appropriate tie-ups with credit and marketing agencies. The coconut procurement system through Krishi Bhavans in association with Kerafed was introduced in 2012-13, which needs further streamlining. The initiative taken by the government in promoting neera and value addition are expected to revive coconut economy of the state.\\nPepper\\nIndia comes third in the production of pepper in the world after Vietnam and Indonesia. However, the production of pepper in the country has been stagnant at around 50,000 tonnes in the last few years and hence is fast losing its status as a leading producer and exporter of pepper. Grown mostly in the slopes of Western Ghats in Kerala, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu, the area under cultivation of pepper has come down drastically in the last decade, which has adversely affected production and export. In 2015-16, pepper production recorded a decline to 55,000 tonnes from 70,000 tonnes in 2014-15. However, Kerala, which accounts for 75 percent of the total production in the country, recorded a slight increase in pepper production from 40.6 thousand tonnes in 2014-15 to 42.1 thousand tonnes in 2015-16. \\nWith regard to prices, there has been a rally in pepper prices since 2010. However, in 2015, the prices registered a decline to 630.31 per kg from 646.79 per kg in 2014. The price realization during 2016 (January-June) was 669.29 per kg compared to 619.76 per kg in June 2015, an increase of  49.53 per kg.\\xa0\\nPepper production in the State in recent years has been affected mainly by low productivity and various diseases. In order to revive spices development in the state, the Department of Agriculture had initiated comprehensive pepper development programmes in all districts in 2014-15. An integrated action plan was prepared for the revival of the crop, covering reorientation of planting material production, expansion of grafting wherever possible, area-wide disease management, liming and nutrients management and revival of pepper samities. The increase in production achieved during 2015-16 could be because of this concerted effort by the State Government.\\nCashewcrore was released by GoI of which 100 \\r\\n                crore (66 per cent) was utilised upto March 2016. \\nA number of small schemes are included for assistance under RKVY \\r\\n                in the state like adoption of naturally ventilated greenhouse \\r\\n                technology, adoption of precision farming technology, establishment \\r\\n                of mushroom cultivation units, popularization of temperate fruit \\r\\n                crops in Idukki district, and development of cool season vegetables \\r\\n                in Kanthaloor and Vattavada. .

During 2015-16, 1,02,467 MT of fruits \\r\\n                and vegetables worth 230 crore were traded \\r\\n                through swasraya karshaka samithies of the council and a trading \\r\\n                of 83,473 MT worth 180 crore has been \\r\\n                traded upto September 2016. Ready to cook vegetables were made \\r\\n                available in packets to public through cut vegetable scheme implemented \\r\\n                in Thiruvananthapuram, Ernakulam, Calicut and Pathanamthitta districts. \\r\\n                Around 65.15 lakh vegetable seedlings, 5.57 lakh tissue culture \\r\\n                banana plants and 9 lakhs fruit plant grafts were produced and \\r\\n                distributed throughout the state to promote homestead cultivation. \\r\\n                An amount of 70.06 crore was disbursed \\r\\n                as agriculture loan to 9187 farmers. A total of 25.11 lakh banana \\r\\n                plants and 800 ha of vegetables were covered under crop insurance \\r\\n                and an amount of 69.31 lakhs was disbursed \\r\\n                to farmers as claim. \\nDuring 2015-16, farmers of the council had cultivated vegetables \\r\\n                in 18,290 ha, banana in 23,400 ha and tuber crops in 3264 ha during \\r\\n                the period. Total production during the period was 1.84 lakh MT \\r\\n                vegetables, 2.81 lakh MT banana and 37,339 MT of tubers. It is \\r\\n                seen that even though the area of banana increased by 712 ha during \\r\\n                2015-16, compared to previous year, production decreased by 13,000 \\r\\n                MT. During 2015-16, the area and production of vegetables decreased \\r\\n                by 1923 ha and 38,000 MT. The area as well as production of tubers \\r\\n                increased during the period compared to 2014-15. \\nFor popularising vegetable and fruit production and area expansion \\r\\n                of vegetables under PGS, 175 groups have been formed with 1200 \\r\\n                farmers. Agro meteorological data have been collected from 26 \\r\\n                Automatic weather stations installed in different parts of the \\r\\n                state with the participation of farmers. As part of vegetableAgriculture and Allied Sectors\\nCrop wise Analysis\\nRice\\nRice is the most important food crop grown in Kerala. It occupies 7.46 percent of the total cropped area of the state. However, the area under rice has been falling at an alarming rate ever since the 1980s. From 8.82 lakh hectare in 1974-75, the paddy area has come down to 1.96 lakh hectare in 2015-16. The production has also concomitantly declined from 13.76 lakh MT in 1972-73 (peak of production) to 5.49 lakh MT in 2015-16 (Appendix 2.4). Moreover, the productivity of the crop is very low in the State (2790 kg/ha), though it is higher than the national average (2424 kg/ha). There has only been a marginal increase in the productivity of rice in the past four decades. China, which is the major producer of rice in the world, reports a productivity (6744 kg/ha) more than three times the productivity of rice in Kerala. The productivity of rice in Egypt is the highest in the world (9088 kg/ha), which is nearly four-fold of our productivity. Punjab is the state with the highest yield in the country (3952 kg/ha). In the recent months, the State government has taken a number of steps for the promotion of paddy cultivation.\\n\\nMajor initiatives for the promotion of rice in 2016-17 \\n\\nPromotion of upland rice cultivation in 2520 ha\\nAmendment in Paddy land/Wetland Conservation Act\\nCultivation in fallow lands\\nSpecial projects in Aranmula Punja\\n Declaring Chingam 1st of 2016 to Chingam 1st of 2017 as the rice year in which 100 activities are planned\\nEnhancement of procurement price of paddy from 21.50/Kg to 22.50/Kg\\n\\n Source: Agriculture Department\\nThere are three main rice growing seasons in the state: (a) Virippu season/Autumn season/First crop season, which starts in April-May and extends up to September-October; (b) Mundakan season/Winter season/Second crop season, which starts in September-October and extends up to December-January; and (c) Puncha season/Summer season/Third crop season, which starts in December-January and extends up to March-April. In Kerala, winter crop (mundakan) has been greater than the other two crops (summer and autumn) both in terms of area as well as production. However, in 2015-16, all the three seasons showed a declining trend resulting in an overall reduction in production(Appendix 2.5). \\nPalakkad, Alappuzha, Thrissur and Kottayam account for about 81.2 percent of the total production of rice in the state, their individual shares being 41 percent, 16 percent, 14 percent and 9 percent respectively. In 2015-16, Alappuzha and Palakkad recorded a decline in production, while Thrissur and Kottayam recorded a slight increase in production. District-wise area under rice cultivation shows that area under rice fell for all the districts of the State between 1996-97 and 2012-13. However, the decline was sharpest for Ernakulam (93 per cent) followed by Kollam (92 per cent), Thiruvananthapuram (86 per cent) and Malappuram (78 per cent). On the positive side, in Kottayam and Alappuzha, the major rice growing districts, the decline was much less pronounced (13 and 12 per cent respectively). In 2015-16, Palakkad, Alappuzha and Wayanad, showed a decline in area as well as production of rice in the State (Details as given in Appendix 2.6 and Appendix 2.7 and Figure 2.4).\\r\\n\\xa0\\nFigure 2.4\\r\\n              Percentage change in area and production of rice in major districts \\r\\n              of Kerala during 2015-16 over 2014-15, in per cent'"
